    "## Objectives\n",
    "The goal of the second part of the first [TAL](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/cours-tal/) lab is to run simple operations for text analysis using the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) toolkit.  You will use the environment that you set up in the first part of the first lab (Labo 1a): [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, either using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use NLTK functions to get texts from the web or local files, and segment (split) them into sentences and words (also called *tokens*).  You will also experiment with extracting some statistics about the texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your practical work to the teachers, please execute all cells of your Jupyter notebook, then print it as a PDF document, and [email both files to the teacher](mailto:andrei.popescu-belis@heig-vd.ch)."

    "You should now add NLTK to your local Python installation, by following the instructions at the [NLTK website](http://www.nltk.org/install.html).  On Google Colab, NLTK is already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started with NLTK is to look at [Chapter 1](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html) of the [NLTK book (NLP with Python)](http://www.nltk.org/book/) and to try some of the instructions there.  Note that the online book is updated for Python 3, but the printed book, also available in PDF on some websites, is only for Python 2 ([_Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit_, Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, O'Reilly Media, 2009](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516499.do)). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use NLTK in a Jupyter notebook, all you need is to `import nltk` before you need it.  You will still need to use the prefix `nltk.` unless you write for instance: `from nltk.book import *` (this will also import and define several long texts too).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* NLTK includes a download manager which can be called from a Python interpreter using `import nltk` and then `nltk.download()`.  This can automatically download from the NLTK repository a large number of text collections (_corpora_).  In this practical session, we will not use any of these."

      "wrenching a livelihood from the water. This capacity for tilling the soil\r\n",
      "instead of gambling in fish had made of Glenn, and a few other men, the\r\n",

      "the red rock became her sanctuary. To it she carried her daily task of\r\n",
      "sewing and dreamed her long dreams.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Glenns rarely went to church--the distance was too great--but\r\n",
      "Nathaniel, looming high and stern across the table in the bare kitchen,\r\n",
      "morning and night, set forth the rigid, unlovely creed of his belief.\r\n",
      "This fell upon Priscilla's unheeding ears, but the hours before the\r\n",
      "shrine were deeply, tenderly religious, although they were bright and\r\n",
      "merry hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, during the years, there were the regular Kenmore happenings\r\n",
      "that impressed the girl to a greater or lesser degree, but they were like\r\n",
      "pictures thrown upon a screen--they came, they went, while her inner\r\n",
      "growth was steady and sure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two families, one familiar and commonplace, the other more mystical than\r\n",
      "anything else, interested Priscilla mightily during her early youth.\r\n",
      "Jerry and Michael McAlpin, with little Jerry-Jo, the son of old Jerry,\r\n",
      "were vital factors in Kenmore. They occupied the exalted position of\r\n",
      "rural expressmen, and distributed, when various things did not interfere,\r\n",
      "the occasional freight and mail that survived the careless methods of the\r\n",
      "vicinity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The McAlpin brothers were hard drinkers, but they were most considerate.\r\n",
      "When Jerry indulged, Michael remained sober and steady; when Michael fell\r\n",
      "before temptation, Jerry pulled himself together in a marvellous way, and\r\n",
      "so, as a firm, they had surmounted every inquiry and suspicion of a\r\n",
      "relentless government and were welcomed far and wide, not only for their\r\n",
      "legitimate business, but for the amount of gossip and scandal they\r\n",
      "disbursed along with their load. Jerry-Jo, the son of the older McAlpin,\r\n",
      "was four years older than Priscilla and was the only really young\r\n",
      "creature who had ever entered her life intimately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other family, of whom the girl thought vaguely, as she might have of\r\n",
      "a story, were the Travers of the Far Hill Place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it might seem strange to more social minds that people from a distant\r\n",
      "city could come summer after summer to the same spot and yet remain\r\n",
      "unknown to their nearest neighbours; but Kenmore was not a social\r\n",
      "community. It had all the reserve of its English heritage combined with\r\n",
      "the suspicion of its Indian taint, and it took strangers hard. Then,\r\n",
      "added to this, the Traverses aroused doubt, for no one, especially\r\n",
      "Nathaniel Glenn, could account for a certain big, heavy-browed man who\r\n",
      "shared the home life of the Hill Place without any apparent right or\r\n",
      "position. For Mrs. Travers, Glenn had managed to conjure up a very actual\r\n",
      "distrust. She was too good-looking and free-acting to be sound; and her\r\n",
      "misshapen and delicate son was, so the severe man concluded, a curse, in\r\n",
      "all probability, for past offences. The youth of Kenmore was straight and\r\n",
      "hearty, unless--and here Nathaniel recalled his superstitions--dire\r\n",
      "vengeance was wreaked on parents through their offspring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With no better reason than this, and with the stubbornness he mistook for\r\n",
      "strength, Glenn would have nothing to do with his neighbours, four miles\r\n",
      "back in the woods, and had forbidden the sale of milk and garden stuff to\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this Priscilla had heard, as children do, but she had never seen any\r\n",
      "member of the family from the Far Hill Place, and mentally relegated them\r\n",
      "to the limbo of the damned under the classification of \"them, from the\r\n",
      "States.\" Their name, even, was rarely mentioned, and, while curiosity\r\n",
      "often swayed her, temptation had never overruled obedience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The McAlpins, with all their opportunity and qualifications, found little\r\n",
      "about the strangers from which to make talk. The family were reserved,\r\n",
      "and Tough Pine, the Indian guide they had impressed into summer service,\r\n",
      "was either bought or, from natural inclination, kept himself to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So, until the summer when she was fourteen, Priscilla Glenn knew less\r\n",
      "about the Far Hill people than she did about the inhabitants of heaven\r\n",
      "and hell, with whom her father was upon such intimate and familiar terms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once, when Priscilla was ten, something had occurred which prepared her\r\n",
      "for following events. It was a bright morning and the McAlpin boat\r\n",
      "stopped at the wharf of Lonely Farm. While old Jerry went to the\r\n",
      "farmhouse with a package, Jerry-Jo remained on guard deeply engrossed in\r\n",
      "a book he had extracted from a box beneath the seat. He appeared not to\r\n",
      "notice Priscilla, who ran down the path to greet him in friendly fashion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy was about fifteen then, and all the bloods of his various\r\n",
      "ancestors were warring in his veins. His mother had been a full-blooded\r\n",
      "Indian from Wyland Island, had drawn her four dollars every year from the\r\n",
      "English Government, and ruled her family with an iron hand; his father\r\n",
      "was Scotch-Irish, hot-blooded and jovial; Jerry-Jo was a composite\r\n",
      "result. Handsome, moody, with flashes of fun when not crossed, a good\r\n",
      "comrade at times, an unforgiving enemy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He liked Priscilla, but she was his inferior, by sex, and she sorely\r\n",
      "needed discipline. He meant to keep her in her place, so he kept on\r\n",
      "reading. Priscilla at length, however, attracted his attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hey-ho, Jerry-Jo!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hullo!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where did you get the book?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's for him up yonder.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with this Jerry-Jo stood up, turned and twisted his lithe body into\r\n",
      "such a grotesque distortion that he was quite awful to look upon, and\r\n",
      "left no doubt in the girl's mind as to whom he referred. He brought the\r\n",
      "Far Hill people into focus, sharply and suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He has miles of books,\" Jerry-Jo went on, \"and a fiddle and pictures and\r\n",
      "gewgaws. He plays devil tunes, and he's bewitched!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This description made the vague boy of the woods real and vital for the\r\n",
      "first time in Priscilla's life, and she shuddered. Then Jerry-Jo\r\n",
      "generously offered to lend her one of the books until his father came\r\n",
      "back, and Priscilla eagerly stepped from stone to stone until she could\r\n",
      "reach the volume. Once she had obtained the prize she went back to the\r\n",
      "garden and made herself comfortable, wholly forgetting Jerry-Jo and the\r\n",
      "world at large.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the oddest book she had ever seen. The words were arranged in\r\n",
      "charming little rows, and when you read them over and over they sang\r\n",
      "themselves into your very heart. They told you, lilting along, of a road\r\n",
      "that no one but you ever knew--a road that led in and out through wonders\r\n",
      "of beauty and faded at the day's end into your heart's desire. Your\r\n",
      "Heart's Desire!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And just then Jerry-Jo cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hey, there! you, Priscilla, come down with that book.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your Heart's Desire!\" Priscilla's eyes were misty as she repeated the\r\n",
      "words. Indeed, one large, full tear escaped the blue eyes and lay like a\r\n",
      "pitiful kiss on the fair page, where there was a broad, generous space\r\n",
      "for tears on either side of the lines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hist! Father's coming!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Priscilla stood up and a demon seemed to possess her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not going to give it back to you! It's mine!\" she cried shrilly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo made as if he were about to dash up the path and annihilate her,\r\n",
      "but she stayed him by holding the book aloft and calling:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you do I'll throw it in the Channel!\" She looked equal to it, too,\r\n",
      "and Jerry-Jo swore one angry word and stopped short. Then the girl's mood\r\n",
      "changed. Quite gently and noiselessly she ran to Jerry-Jo and held the\r\n",
      "opened book toward him. His keen eye fell upon the tear-stain, but his\r\n",
      "coarser nature wrongly interpreted it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You imp!\" he cried; \"you spat upon it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Priscilla shook her head. \"No--it's a tear,\" she explained; \"and, oh!\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo, it is mine--listen!--you cannot take it away from me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And standing there upon the rock she repeated the words of the poem, her\r\n",
      "rich voice rising and falling musically, and poor Jerry-Jo, hypnotized by\r\n",
      "that which he could not comprehend, listened open-mouthed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, again, it was spring and Priscilla was fourteen. Standing in the\r\n",
      "garden path, her yoke across her shoulders, her ears straining at the\r\n",
      "sound she heard, the old poem returned to her as it had not for years.\r\n",
      "She faltered over the words at the first attempt, but with the second\r\n",
      "they rushed vividly to her mind and seemed set to the music of that\r\n",
      "\"pat-pat-pat\" sound on the water. An unaccountable excitement seized\r\n",
      "her--that new but thrilling sense of nearness and kinship to life and the\r\n",
      "lovely meaning of spring. She was no longer a little girl looking on at\r\n",
      "life; she was part of it; and something was going to happen after the\r\n",
      "long shut-in winter!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And presently the McAlpin boat came in sight around Lone Tree Island\r\n",
      "and in it stood Jerry-Jo quite alone, paddling straight for the\r\n",
      "landing-place! For a moment Priscilla hardly knew him. The winter\r\n",
      "had worked a wonder upon him. He was almost a man! He had the manners,\r\n",
      "too, of his kind--he ignored the girl on the rocks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he had seen her; seen her before she had seen him. He had noted\r\n",
      "the wonderful change in her, for eighteen is keen about fourteen,\r\n",
      "particularly when fourteen is full of promise and belongs, in a\r\n",
      "sense, to one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The short, ugly frock Priscilla wore could not hide the beauty and grace\r\n",
      "of her young body--the winter had wiped out forever her awkward length of\r\n",
      "limb. Her reddish hair was twisted on the top of her head and made her\r\n",
      "look older and more mature. Her uplifted face had the shining radiancy\r\n",
      "that was its chief charm, and as Jerry-Jo looked he was moved to\r\n",
      "admiration, and for that very reason he assumed indifference and gave\r\n",
      "undivided attention to his boat.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With skill and grace Jerry-Jo steered his boat to the landing-place at\r\n",
      "the foot of the garden. He leaped out and tied the rope to the ring in\r\n",
      "the rocks, then he waited for Priscilla to pay homage, but Priscilla was\r\n",
      "so absorbed with her own thoughts that she overlooked the expected\r\n",
      "tribute of sex to sex. At last Jerry-Jo stood upright, legs wide apart,\r\n",
      "hands in pockets, and, with bold, handsome face thrown back, cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, there!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Priscilla started, gave a light laugh, and readjusting her yoke,\r\n",
      "walked down to the young fellow below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's Jerry-Jo,\" she said slowly, still held by the change in him; \"and\r\n",
      "alone!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\" Jerry-Jo gave a gleaming smile that showed all his strong, white\r\n",
      "teeth--long, keen teeth they were, like the fangs of an animal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are the others?\" asked Priscilla.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Uncle's dead,\" the boy returned promptly and cheerfully; \"dead, and a\r\n",
      "good thing. He was getting cranky.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla started back as if the mention of death on that glorious day\r\n",
      "cast a cloud and a shadow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And your father, Jerry-Jo, is he, too, dead?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Dad, he is in jail!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In--jail!\" Never in her life before had Priscilla known of any one being\r\n",
      "in Kenmore jail. The red, wooden house behind its high, stockade fence\r\n",
      "was at once the pride and relic of the place. To have a jail and never\r\n",
      "use it! What more could be said for the peaceful virtues of a community?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Dad's in jail and in jail he will stay, says he, till them as put\r\n",
      "him there begs his pardon humble and proper.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla now dropped the yoke upon the rocks and gave her entire thought\r\n",
      "to Jerry-Jo, who, she could see, was bursting with importance and a sense\r\n",
      "of the dramatic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What did your father do, Jerry-Jo?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was like this: Uncle Michael died and the wake we had for him was the\r\n",
      "most splendid you ever saw. Bottles and kegs from the White Fish and\r\n",
      "money to pay for all, too! Every one welcome and free to say his say and\r\n",
      "drink his fill. I got drunk myself! Long about midnight Big Hornby he\r\n",
      "said as how he once licked Uncle Michael, and Dad he cried back that to\r\n",
      "blacken a man's name when he was too dead to stand up for it was a dirty\r\n",
      "trick, and so it was! Then it was forth and back for a time, with\r\n",
      "compliments and what not, and if you please just as Dad sent a bit of a\r\n",
      "stool at Big Hornby, who should come in at the door but Mr. Schoolmaster,\r\n",
      "him as had no invite and was not wanted! The stool took him full on the\r\n",
      "arm and broke it--the arm--and folks took sides, and some one, after a\r\n",
      "bit, got Dad from under the pile and tried to make him beg pardon! Beg\r\n",
      "pardon at his own wake in his own home, and Schoolmaster taking chances\r\n",
      "coming when he was not invited! Umph!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo's eyes flashed superbly.\r\n",

      "mind of Big Hornby, and he up and says, 'To jail with him!' And so they\r\n",
      "takes Dad, thinking to scare him, and claps him into jail, not even\r\n",
      "mending the lock or nailing up the boards. That's three days since, and\r\n",
      "yesterday Hornby he comes to Dad and says as how a steamer was in with\r\n",
      "mail and freight and who was to carry it around? And Dad says as how I\r\n",
      "was a man now and could hold up the honour of the family, says he, and\r\n",
      "moreover, says Dad, 'I'll neither eat nor come out till you come to your\r\n",
      "senses and beg pardon for mistaking a joke for an insult!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo paused to laugh. Then:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So here am I with the boatload--there's a box of seeds for your\r\n",
      "father--and then I'm off to the Hill Place, for them as stays there has\r\n",
      "come, and there are boxes and packages for them as usual.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo proceeded to extract Mr. Glenn's box from the boat, and\r\n",

      "the cargo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More books!\" she gasped. \"Oh, Jerry-Jo, do you remember the first book?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do I?\" Jerry-Jo had shouldered the box of seeds and now bent upon the\r\n",
      "girl a glad, softened look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do I? You was a wild thing then, Priscilla. And I told him about the\r\n",
      "slob of a tear and he laughed in his big, queer way, and he said, I\r\n",
      "remember well, that by that token the book was more yours than his, and\r\n",
      "he wanted me to carry it back, but I knew what was good for you, and I\r\n",
      "would not! See here, Priscilla, would you like to have a peek at this?\"\r\n",
      "And then Jerry-Jo put his burden down, and, returning to the boat, drew\r\n",
      "from under the seat a book in a clean separate wrapper and held it out\r\n",
      "toward her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" The hands were as eager as of old.\r\n",

      "filled her pails and had carried them and the book to the house.\r\n",
      "Something had happened to her, also. She was out of tune with the\r\n",
      "sunlight and warmth; she wanted to get close to life again and feel, as\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was after the dishes of the midday meal were washed that she bethought\r\n",

      "had been there--not since the autumn before--and she felt old and\r\n",
      "different, but still she had a sudden desire to return to it and try\r\n",
      "again the mystic rite she had practised when she was a little girl. It\r\n",
      "was like going back to play, to be sure; all the sacredness was gone, but\r\n",
      "the interest remained, and her yearning spurred her to her only resource.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At two o'clock Nathaniel was off to a distant field, and Theodora\r\n",
      "announced that she must walk to the village for a bit of \"erranding.\" She\r\n",
      "wanted Priscilla to join her, thinking it would please the girl, but\r\n",
      "Priscilla shook her head and pleaded a weariness that was more mental\r\n",
      "than physical. At three o'clock, arrayed in a fresh gown, over which hung\r\n",
      "a red cape, Priscilla stole from the house and made her way to the\r\n",
      "opening near the woods. As she drew close the power of suggestion\r\n",
      "overcame the new sense of age and indifference; the witchery of the place\r\n",
      "held her; the old charm reasserted itself; she was being hypnotized by\r\n",
      "the Past. Tiptoeing to the niche in the rock she drew away the sheltering\r\n",
      "boughs and branches she had placed there one golden September day. The\r\n",
      "leaves had been red and yellow then; they were stiff and brown now. The\r\n",
      "leering skull confronted her as it had in the past and changed her at\r\n",
      "once to the devotee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before the dead thing the live, lovely creature bowed gravely. After all,\r\n",
      "had not the image, instead of God, answered her first prayer? Nathaniel's\r\n",
      "heart had not been softened and school had not been permitted, but there\r\n",
      "had been lessons given by the master when she told him of her new god.\r\n",
      "How he had laughed, clapping his knees with his long, thin, white hands!\r\n",
      "But he had taught her on hillside and woodland path. No one knew this but\r\n",
      "themselves and the strange idol!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A rapt look spread over Priscilla's face; the look of the worshipper who\r\n",
      "could lose self in a passion. But this was no dread god that demanded\r\n",
      "unlovely sacrifice. It was a glad creature that desired laughter, song,\r\n",
      "and dance. Priscilla had seen to that. A repetition of her father's creed\r\n",
      "would have been unendurable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Skib, skib, skibble--de--de--dosh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the deep and sweeping courtesy and chanting of the weird words. The\r\n",
      "final \"dosh!\" held, in its low, fierce tone, all the significance of\r\n",
      "abject adoration. With that \"dosh\" had the child Priscilla wooed the\r\n",
      "favour and recognition of the god. It was a triumph of appeal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then the dance began--the wild, fantastic steps full of grace and joy\r\n",
      "and the fury and passion of youth. Round and round spun the slight form,\r\n",
      "with arms over head or spread wide. The red cape floated, rising and\r\n",
      "falling; the uplifted face changed with every moment's flitting thought.\r\n",
      "It was a beautiful thing, that dance, grotesque, pagan, and yet divine,\r\n",
      "and through it all, panting and pulsing, sounded the strange,\r\n",
      "incomprehensible words:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Skib, skib, skibble--de--de--dosh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the rite was at high tide a young fellow, lying prone under a\r\n",
      "clump of trees beyond the open space, looked on, first in amaze mingled\r\n",
      "with amusement, and then with delight and admiration. He had never\r\n",
      "seen anything at once so heathenish and so exquisite. To one hampered\r\n",
      "and restricted as he was in bodily freedom, the absolute grace was\r\n",
      "marvellous, but the uncanny words and the girl's apparent seriousness\r\n",
      "gave a touch of unreality to the scene. Presently, from sheer inability\r\n",
      "to further control himself, the looker-on gave a laugh that rent the\r\n",
      "stillness of the afternoon like a cruel shock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla, horrified, paused in the midst of a wild whirl and listened,\r\n",
      "her eyes dilating, her nostrils twitching. She waited for another burst\r\n",
      "that would make her understand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having given vent to that one peal of mirth, Richard Travers pulled\r\n",
      "himself to a sitting position, and, by so doing, presented his head and\r\n",
      "shoulders to the indignant eyes of Priscilla Glenn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" cried she; \"how dare you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now Travers got rather painfully upon his feet, and, with fiddle\r\n",
      "under one arm and book under the other, came forward into the open and\r\n",
      "inclined his uncovered head. He was twenty then, fair and handsome, and\r\n",
      "in his gray eyes shone that kindliness that was doomed later on to bring\r\n",
      "him so much that was both evil and good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I beg your pardon. I did not know I was on sacred ground. I just\r\n",
      "happened here, you see, and I could not help the laugh; it was the only\r\n",
      "compliment I could pay for anything so lovely--so utterly lovely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla melted at once and fear fled. Not for an instant did she\r\n",
      "connect this handsome fellow with the crooked wrongdoer of the Hill\r\n",
      "Place. Jerry-Jo's long-ago description had been too vivid to be\r\n",
      "forgotten, and this stranger was one to charm and win confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Will you--oh! please do--let me play for you? You dance like a nymph. Do\r\n",
      "you know what a nymph is?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's the only thing that can dance like you; the only thing that\r\n",
      "should ever be allowed to dance in the woods. Come, now, listen sharp,\r\n",
      "and as I play, keep step.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leaning against a strong young hemlock, Dick Travers placed his fiddle\r\n",
      "and struck into a giddy, tuneful thing as picturesque as the time and\r\n",
      "occasion. With head bent to one side and eyes and lips smiling, Priscilla\r\n",
      "listened until something within her caught and responded to the tripping\r\n",
      "notes. At first she went cautiously, feeling her way after the enchanted\r\n",
      "music, then she gained courage, and the very heart of her danced and\r\n",
      "trembled in accord.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fine! fine! Now--slower; see it's the nymph stepping this way and that!\r\n",
      "Forward, so! Now!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then, exhausted and laughing madly, Priscilla sank down upon a rock\r\n",
      "near the musician, who, seeing her worn and panting, played on, without\r\n",
      "a word, a sweet, sad strain that brought tears to the listener's\r\n",
      "eyes--tears of absolute enjoyment and content. She had never heard music\r\n",
      "before in all her bleak, colourless life, and Dick Travers was no mean\r\n",
      "artist, in his way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now,\" he said presently, sitting down a few feet from her, \"just\r\n",
      "tell me who you are and what in the world prompts you to worship, so\r\n",
      "adorably, that hideous brute over there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between fourteen and twenty lies a chasm of age and experience that\r\n",
      "ensures patronage to one and dependence to the other. Travers felt aged\r\n",
      "and protecting, but Priscilla grew impish and perverse; besides, she\r\n",
      "always intuitively shielded her real self until she capitulated entirely.\r\n",
      "This was a new play, a new comrade, but she must be cautious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I have no name--he made me!\" She nodded toward the grinning skull.\r\n",
      "\"On bright sunny afternoons in spring, when flowers and green things are\r\n",
      "beginning to live, he lets me dance, once in a great while, so that I can\r\n",
      "keep alive!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla, with this, gave such a beaming and mischievous smile that\r\n",
      "Travers was bewitched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You----\" But he did not put his thought into words; he merely gave smile\r\n",
      "for smile, and asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did he teach you to dance?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. The dance is--is me! That's why he likes me. He's so dead that he\r\n",
      "likes to see something that is alive.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The whole world would adore you could it see you as I just have!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Travers, with the artist's eye, wondered how dark hair could\r\n",
      "possibly hold such golden tints, and how such a dark face could make\r\n",
      "lovely the blue, richly lashed eyes. He knew she must be from Lonely\r\n",
      "Farm--Jerry-Jo used to speak of her; lately he had said nothing, to be\r\n",
      "sure, but this certainly must be the child who had once cried over a\r\n",
      "book of his. Poor, little, temperamental beggar!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come up and deliver!\" Travers gave a laugh. \"I'm Robin Hood and I want\r\n",
      "you to explain yourself. Why do you bow down before that brazen and\r\n",
      "evil-looking brute?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla hugged her knees in her clasped hands, and said, on the\r\n",
      "defence:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's the only god that answered my prayer. I tried father's God and--it\r\n",
      "didn't work! Then I fixed up this one, and--it did!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What was it you wanted?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wanted to learn things! I wanted to go to school. I prayed to have\r\n",
      "father's heart softened, but it stayed--rocky. Then I began to worship\r\n",
      "this\"--the right hand waved toward the bleached and grinning skull--\"and\r\n",
      "my wish came true. I told the schoolmaster. Do you know Mr. Anton\r\n",
      "Farwell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've heard of him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I told him I wanted to learn, and after he got through laughing he said\r\n",
      "he'd been sent by my god to teach me all I wanted to know; but of course\r\n",
      "he can't do that!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do what?\" Travers was fascinated by the child's naivety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Teach me all I want to know. Why, I'm going to suffer and know many\r\n",
      "things!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good Lord!\" ejaculated Travers; \"you won't mind if I laugh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think there's anything to laugh at!\" Priscilla held him sternly.\r\n",
      "\"Have you ever suffered?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The laugh died from Travers's face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Suffered!\" he repeated. \"Yes! yes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, doesn't it pay--when you get what you want and know things?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, see here, youngster--it does! You've managed to dig out of your\r\n",
      "life quite a brilliant philosophy, though I suppose you do not know what\r\n",
      "that is. It's holding to your ideal, the thing that seems most worth\r\n",
      "while, and forcing everything else into line with that. Now, you see I\r\n",
      "had a bad handicap--a clutch on me that made me a weak, sickly fellow,\r\n",
      "but through it all I kept my ideal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was listening bravely. She was following this thought as she\r\n",
      "had the music; something in her was responding. She did not speak, and\r\n",
      "Travers went on talking, more to himself than to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Always before the poor thing I really was, walked the fine thing I would\r\n",
      "be. I _thought_ myself straight and strong and clean. Lord! how it hurt\r\n",
      "sometimes; but I grew, after a time, into something approaching the ideal\r\n",
      "going on before me, thinking high and strong thoughts, forgetting the\r\n",
      "meannesses and aches--do you understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a fairy story to the listener. Rigid and spellbound she replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. And that's what I've been doing--and nobody knew. I've just been\r\n",
      "working hard for that _me_ of _me_ that I always see. I don't care what\r\n",
      "I have to suffer, but--\" the throbbing words paused--\"I'm going to know\r\n",
      "what--it is all about!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It?\" Again Travers was bewildered and bound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Life and me and what we mean. I'm not going to stay here; when the\r\n",
      "lure of the States gets me I'm--going!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Things were getting too tense, and Travers yielded to a nervous impulse\r\n",
      "to laugh again. This brought a frown to Priscilla's brow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Forgive me!\" he pleaded. \"And now see here, little pagan, let us make\r\n",
      "a compact. Let us keep our ideals; don't let anything take them from us.\r\n",
      "Is it a go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stretched his hand out, and the small, brown one lay frankly in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And we'll come here and--and worship before that fiend, just you and I?\r\n",
      "And we won't ever tell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now will you dance once more, just once?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl bounded from the rock, and before the bow struck the strings she\r\n",
      "was poised and ready. Then it was on again, that strange, wild game. The\r\n",
      "notes rang clear and true, and as true tripped the twinkling feet. With\r\n",
      "head bent and eyes riveted on the graceful form, Travers urged her on by\r\n",
      "word and laugh, and he did not heed a shadow which fell across the\r\n",
      "sunlighted, open space, until Priscilla stopped short, and a deep voice\r\n",
      "trembling with emotion roared one word:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There stood Nathaniel Glenn, his face twitching with anger and something\r\n",
      "akin to fear. How much he had heard no one could tell, but he had heard\r\n",
      "and seen enough to arouse alarm and suspicion. In his hand was a long\r\n",
      "lash whip, and, as Priscilla did not move, he raised it aloft and sent it\r\n",
      "snapping around the rigid figure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It did not touch her, but the act called forth all the resentment and\r\n",
      "fierce indignation of the young fellow who looked on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop!\" he shouted. Then, because he sought for words to comfort and\r\n",
      "could think of no others, he said to Priscilla, \"Don't let them kill your\r\n",
      "ideal; hold to it in spite of everything!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" the words came slowly, defiantly, \"I'm going to!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go!\" Nathaniel was losing control. \"Go--you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, as if waking from sleep, the girl turned, and with no backward\r\n",
      "look, went her way, Nathaniel following.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers, exhausted from the excitement, stretched himself once more upon\r\n",
      "the mossy spot from which Priscilla had roused him. He was sensitive to\r\n",
      "every impression and quivering in every nerve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What he had witnessed turned him ill with loathing and contempt.\r\n",
      "Brutality in any form was horrible to him, and the thought of the pretty,\r\n",
      "spiritual child under the control of the coarse, stern man was almost\r\n",
      "more than he could bear. Then memory added fuel to the present. It was\r\n",
      "that man who had conjured up some kind of opposition to his mother--had\r\n",
      "made living problems harder for her until she had won the confidence of\r\n",
      "others. The man must be, Travers concluded, a fanatic and an ignoramus,\r\n",
      "and to think of him holding power over that sprite of the woods!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not quite see how he might help the girl, but, lying there, her\r\n",
      "dancing image flitting before his pitying eyes, he meant to outwit the\r\n",
      "rough father in some way, and bring into the child's life a bit of\r\n",
      "brightness. Then he smiled and his easy good nature returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll get her to dance for me, never fear! I'll teach her to love music,\r\n",
      "and I'll tell her stories. I must get her to explain about the lure of\r\n",
      "the States. What on earth could the little beggar have meant? It sounded\r\n",
      "as if she thought America had some sinister clutch on the Dominion. And\r\n",
      "those infernal-sounding words!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers shook with laughter. \"That '_dosh_' was about the most\r\n",
      "blasphemous thing I ever listened to. In a short space of time that child\r\n",
      "managed to cram in more new ideas, words, and acts than any one I've ever\r\n",
      "met before. I shouldn't wonder if she proves a character.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day of warmth and song and dance changed to a cool evening. There was\r\n",
      "a glowing sunset which faded into a clear, starry night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dick Travers, encased in a heavy sweater, lingered, after the light\r\n",
      "failed, on the broad piazza facing the still purpled sky, and looked out\r\n",
      "toward the Georgian Bay, which was hidden from sight by the ridge of hill\r\n",
      "through which the Fox and Secret Portages cut. The mood of the afternoon\r\n",
      "had fallen, as had the day, into calmness and restfulness. The fiddle,\r\n",
      "which was never far from Travers, lay now beside him on the deep porch\r\n",
      "swing, and every few moments he took it up and began an air that broke\r\n",
      "off almost at once, either to run into another, or into silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Choppy,\" muttered Doctor Ledyard as he sat across the hearth from his\r\n",
      "hostess and looked now at her fair, tranquil face and then at the\r\n",
      "cheerful fire of hemlock boughs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's always happiest when he's--choppy.\" Helen Travers smiled. \"I wonder\r\n",
      "why I take your words as I take your pills, without question?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You know what's good for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And so you really think there is no doubt about Dick? He can enter\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"As sure as any man can be. He'll always be a trifle lame probably,\r\n",
      "though that will be less noticeable when he learns to forget the cane and\r\n",
      "crutch periods; as for his health--it's ripping, for him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How wonderful you have been; what a miracle you have performed. When I\r\n",
      "recall----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't, Helen! It's poor business retracing a hard road unless you go\r\n",
      "back to pick something up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's why--I must go back. Doctor Ledyard, I must tell you something!\r\n",
      "Now that Dick's semi-exile and mine are to end in the common highway, he\r\n",
      "and--you must know why I have done many things--will you listen?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From under Ledyard's shaggy brows his keen eyes flashed. There had been\r\n",
      "a time when he had hoped Helen Travers would love him; he had loved\r\n",
      "her since her husband's death, but he had never spoken, for he knew\r\n",
      "intuitively that to do so would be to risk the only thing of which he\r\n",
      "was, then, sure--her trusting friendship. He had not dared put that to\r\n",
      "the test even for the greater hope. That was why he had been able to\r\n",
      "share her lonely life in the Canadian wilds--she had never been disturbed\r\n",
      "by a doubt of him. And this comradeship, safe and assured, was the one\r\n",
      "luxury he permitted himself in a world where he was looked upon as a\r\n",
      "hard, an almost cruel, man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not want you to tell anything in order to explain your actions\r\n",

      "wisely. You are the most normal woman I ever knew.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Dick is not--my son!\" she said quickly and softly from out the shadows.\r\n",

      "There was a tenseness in the question. Now that he saw the gravity of the\r\n",

      "and desires. I cannot get to life first hand. I'm not stupid exactly, but\r\n",
      "I am terribly limited.\" Helen paused, then went on more rapidly: \"First\r\n",
      "it was my father. He and I travelled after mother's death continually,\r\n",
      "and alone. He educated me and interpreted life for me; he was a man of\r\n",
      "the world, I suppose, but he managed to keep me most unworldly wise. Of\r\n",
      "course I knew, abstractly, the lights and shadows; but I wonder if you\r\n",
      "will believe me when I tell you that, until after my marriage, I never\r\n",
      "suspected that--that certain codes of honour and dishonour had place in\r\n",
      "the lives of those closest to me? The evil of the world was classified\r\n",
      "and pigeon-holed for me. I even had ambition to get out of my walled-up\r\n",
      "condition and help some mystical people, detached and far from my safe,\r\n",
      "clean corner. Father left me more money than was good for any young\r\n",

      "was her brother I married--John Travers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ledyard nodded his head; he knew of the Traverses--the older generation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This thing concerning Dick occurred some three or four years before my\r\n",
      "marriage. My wedding was a very quiet one; it was not reported, and that\r\n",
      "accounted for Dick's mother--Elizabeth Thornton--not knowing of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It seems that there had been an alliance between John Travers and--and\r\n",
      "Dick's mother, and it had been terminated some time before he met me, by\r\n",
      "mutual consent. There was the child--Dick. The mother took him. There was\r\n",
      "no question of money: there was enough for them, but she had told John\r\n",
      "that should anything arise, such as illness or disaster, she would call\r\n",

      "it. I realized that his chief concern was for me, and even in all the\r\n",
      "wreck and ruin I could but honour him for his bravery and sincerity. I\r\n",
      "think he believed I would understand, but I never did; I never shall. The\r\n",
      "shock was more surprise than moral resentment. I could not believe at\r\n",
      "first that such a thing could possibly happen to--one of my own. I felt\r\n",
      "as if a plague had fallen upon me, and I shrank from every eye, from\r\n",
      "every touch with the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doctor Ledyard, you can understand, I hope, but John Travers was not a\r\n",
      "bad man, and that girl, Dick's mother, was good. Yes; that's the only\r\n",
      "word to use, strange as it seems to me even after all these years. You\r\n",
      "see, she was not a hornbill. She came in touch with life at first hand;\r\n",
      "she took from life what she wanted; she had, what were to me, unheard-of\r\n",
      "ideas about love and the free gift of self, and yet she never meant to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"When she sent for John she was dying and she did not know what to do\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I went with my husband to see her. There did not seem to be anything\r\n",
      "else to do. I had no feeling; it was plain duty. Even with the touch of\r\n",
      "death upon her, Elizabeth Thornton was the most beautiful woman I have\r\n",
      "ever seen. I cannot describe the sensation she made upon me; but she was\r\n",
      "like an innocent, pure child who had played with harmful and soiled toys\r\n",
      "but had come wearily to the day's end, herself unsullied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When she knew about me she was broken-hearted. She wept and called to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"'Oh! little son, we could have managed, couldn't we? We would not have\r\n",
      "hurt any one for the world, would we, sonny?' And the boy got up and\r\n",
      "soothed her as a man might have done, and he was only a little creature.\r\n",
      "I think I loved him from the moment I saw him shielding that poor, dying\r\n",
      "mother from her own folly. 'Course, mummy, course!' he repeated over and\r\n",
      "again. Then he looked at me with the eyes of my own dead baby. Both\r\n",
      "children were startlingly like the father. The look pleaded for mercy\r\n",
      "from me to them--John, the mother, and the little fellow himself. And I,\r\n",
      "who had vaguely meant to help the world some day, began--with them! Just\r\n",
      "for a little time after Elizabeth Thornton's death I became human, or\r\n",
      "perhaps inhuman. I resented the wrong that had been done me; I wanted to\r\n",
      "fling John and the child away from me; but then a sense of power rallied\r\n",
      "me. I had never tasted it before. I could cast the helpless pair from me,\r\n",
      "or--I could save them from the world and the world's hideous pity for me.\r\n",
      "I accepted the burden laid upon me. I think John thought I would forget,\r\n",
      "would forgive. I cannot explain--my sort of woman is never understood\r\n",
      "by--well, John's sort of man. I am afraid he grew to have a contempt for\r\n",
      "me, but I lived on loving them both, but never becoming able to meet\r\n",
      "John's hope of me. I knew he was often lonely--I have pitied him\r\n",
      "since--but I could not help being what I was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I tried, but it was no use. We lived abroad for years, and little Dick\r\n",
      "forgot--I am sure he forgot--his mother, and when I felt secure I gave\r\n",

      "cold and cheerless, and the still, white figure in the chair seemed the\r\n",
      "quiet, chill heart of it all. And yet--how she had loved and laboured for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Ledyard left the room silently, and a moment later Helen Travers heard\r\n",
      "his heavy footfall on the porch outside. Presently the erratic violin\r\n",
      "playing ceased and there seemed no sound on the face of the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After what seemed hours, Pine, the guide, entered the room to replenish\r\n",
      "the fire, and Helen told him he need not light the lamps. After his going\r\n",
      "another aching silence followed through which, at last, stole the\r\n",
      "consciousness that she was not alone. Some one had come into the room\r\n",
      "from a long window opening on the piazza. Helen dared not look, for if it\r\n",
      "were Ledyard she would know that things were very bad indeed. Then came\r\n",
      "the slightly dragging step that she had learned to be so grateful for\r\n",
      "after the helplessness of crippled childhood. Still she did not move, nor\r\n",
      "deeply hope. The boy was kind, oh! so tenderly kind, he might only have\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "distinct, and toward that Dick Travers went as if led by a gleam through\r\n",
      "a new and strange experience. He knelt by her side and, for a moment,\r\n",
      "buried his face against her clasped hands; then he looked up and she saw\r\n",
      "only intensified love and trust upon his young face. She waited for him\r\n",
      "to speak, her heart was choking her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You thought, dear, that I did not know--that I had forgotten? I wonder\r\n",

      "lifted the load and taught me to be a--child? Oh! she was so sweet; such\r\n",
      "a playfellow. I realize it now even though she has faded into something\r\n",
      "like a shadowy dream. But I recall, too, the loneliness; the fear that\r\n",
      "she might leave me alone with no one to care for me. I can remember her\r\n",
      "fear, too; always the fear that one of us might leave the other alone.\r\n",

      "could do for you, who had given me so much, was to seem to forget and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He kissed the cold hands clutching his hot ones, and with that touch the\r\n",
      "barrier broke down forever between them. Travers took her in his arms,\r\n",

      "to understand a doctor's demands. They usually raise hell sooner or\r\n",
      "later. I had a friend whose wife used to look through the keyhole of his\r\n",
      "consulting-room door. A patient tripped over her once and it nearly cost\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nathaniel Glenn had said some terrible things in Priscilla's presence the\r\n",
      "evening of the day when he drove her before him while Richard Travers\r\n",
      "implored her to hold to her ideal. Fortunately, youth spared Priscilla\r\n",
      "from a full understanding of her father's words, but she caught the drift\r\n",
      "of his thought. She was convinced that he feared greatly for her here on\r\n",
      "earth, and had grave doubts as to her soul's ultimate salvation. There\r\n",
      "was that within her, so he explained, which, unless curbed and corrected,\r\n",
      "would cast her into eternal damnation! Those were Nathaniel's words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She looked a very devil as she danced and smirked at that strange\r\n",
      "fellow,\" so had Glenn described the scene; \"a man she says she had never\r\n",
      "laid eyes on before! A daughter of Satan she seemed, with all the\r\n",
      "witchcraft of her sort.\" To Nathaniel, that which he could not\r\n",
      "understand, was wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Theodora spoke not a word. Certain facts from all the evidence stood\r\n",
      "forth and alarmed her as deeply--though not as bitterly--as they did her\r\n",
      "husband. There certainly was a daring and brazenness in a young girl\r\n",
      "carrying on so before a total stranger. In all the conversation the name\r\n",
      "of the stranger was not mentioned, and oddly enough Priscilla did not\r\n",
      "even then connect her friend of the music and laughter with the boy of\r\n",
      "the Hill Place. How could she, when Jerry-Jo's description still stood\r\n",
      "unchallenged in her mind? Indeed, the stranger did not seem wholly of the\r\n",
      "earth, earthy. She had accepted him as another phase evolved by the\r\n",
      "mysterious rite--a new revelation of the strange god.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From all the torrent of misinterpretation Nathaniel gave vent to, one\r\n",
      "startling impression remained in Priscilla's mind. Sitting in the bare,\r\n",
      "unlovely kitchen of the farmhouse, with her troubled parents confronting\r\n",
      "her, a great wave of realization overpowered the girl. She could never\r\n",
      "make them understand! There was no need to try. She did not really belong\r\n",
      "to them, or they to her, and she must--get away!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was it, of course. The lure had caught her. They all felt as she\r\n",
      "was now feeling--the Hornbys, all the boys and men who left Kenmore.\r\n",
      "Something always drove them to see they must go, and that was what the\r\n",
      "lure meant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At this Theodora gave a moan of understanding. They had driven the child\r\n",
      "too far, been too hard upon her, and the impulse to fly from the love\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm tired of things. Once I wanted to go to school, but you wouldn't let\r\n",
      "me.\" The blazing eyes were fixed upon Nathaniel. \"You're always trying\r\n",

      "I want\"--a half-sob shook the fierce, young voice--\"I want to be part\r\n",
      "of--things, and you--you won't let me! I hate this--this place; I'm\r\n",
      "choking to death!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with this Priscilla got up and flung her arms over her head, while\r\n",
      "she ejaculated fiercely: \"I want to be--doshed!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect of this outburst upon the two listeners was tremendous.\r\n",
      "Theodora recognized with blinding terror that her daughter was no longer\r\n",
      "a child! The knowledge was like a stroke that left her paralyzed. What\r\n",
      "could she hope to do with, and for, this new, strange creature in whose\r\n",
      "young face rising passion and rebellion were suddenly born? Nathaniel was\r\n",
      "awed, too, but he managed to utter the command: \"Leave the room, hussy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the parents were alone they took stock of the responsibility that\r\n",
      "was laid upon them. Helplessly Theodora began to cry. She could no more\r\n",
      "cope with this situation than a baby. She had never risen above or beyond\r\n",
      "the dead level of Kenmore life, and surely no Kenmore woman had ever\r\n",
      "borne so unnatural a child. She feared hopelessly and tremblingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With Nathaniel it was different. He was a hard man who had forced\r\n",
      "himself, as he had others, along the one grim path, but he had the male's\r\n",
      "inheritance of understanding of certain traits and emotions. Had any one\r\n",
      "suggested to him that his girl had derived from him--not her colourless\r\n",
      "mother--the desire for excitement through the senses, he would have flung\r\n",
      "the thought madly from him. Men were men; women were women! Even if\r\n",
      "temptation came to a girl, only a bad, an evil-natured girl would\r\n",
      "recognize it and succumb. His daughter, Nathaniel firmly believed, was\r\n",
      "marked for destruction, and he was frightened and aroused not only for\r\n",
      "Priscilla herself but for his reputation and position. He had known\r\n",
      "similar temptation; had overcome it. He understood, or thought he did!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave the girl no benefit of doubt; his mind conceived things that\r\n",
      "never had occurred. He believed she had often met the young fellow from\r\n",
      "the Hill Place. God alone knew what had gone before!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What shall we do?\" sobbed Theodora. \"We cannot make a prisoner of her;\r\n",
      "we cannot watch her every move--and she's only a bit over fourteen!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had the girl died that night Nathaniel would not have mourned her, he\r\n",
      "would have known only relief and gratitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was unwelcomed,\" he muttered to his weeping wife; \"and she has\r\n",
      "become a curse to us. It lies with us to turn the punishment into our\r\n",
      "souls' good; but what can we do for her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla did not die that night. She slept peacefully and happily with\r\n",
      "the red, pulsing planet over the hemlock shining faithfully upon her. The\r\n",
      "next day she reappeared before her parents with a cloudless face and a\r\n",
      "willingness to make such amends as could be brought about without too\r\n",
      "much self-abnegation. In the broad light of day the mother could not hold\r\n",
      "to the horrors of the evening before. She had been nervous and\r\n",
      "overwrought; it wasn't so bad as they had thought!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want you to go erranding,\" she said to Priscilla soon after the midday\r\n",
      "meal and by way of propitiation. \"It's one by the clock now. Given an\r\n",
      "hour to go, another to return, and a half hour for the buying, you should\r\n",
      "be back by four at the latest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla looked laughingly up at her mother, \"Funny, little mother,\" she\r\n",
      "said; \"he's made you afraid of me. Hadn't you better tie a string to my\r\n",
      "foot?\" But all the time the girl was thinking. \"An hour for both going\r\n",
      "and coming will be enough, and that will leave an hour for the\r\n",
      "schoolmaster.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aloud she said: \"I was fiercely angry last night, mother, for he read me\r\n",
      "wrong and would not believe me, but it made me feel the _lure_; it really\r\n",
      "did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must never speak so again, child,\" Theodora replied, thinking she\r\n",
      "was impressing the girl; \"and, Priscilla, what did you mean by saying you\r\n",
      "wanted to be--be doshed? That was the most unsanctified word I ever\r\n",
      "heard. What does it mean? Where did you learn it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Priscilla doubled over with laughter but managed to say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it means just--doshed! Haven't you ever wanted to be doshed,\r\n",
      "mother, when you were young, and before father took the dosh out of\r\n",
      "you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Theodora was again overcome by former fears, and to confirm her terror\r\n",
      "Priscilla sprang toward her with outstretched, gripping fingers and wide,\r\n",
      "eager eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It means,\" she breathed, advancing upon her mother's retreating form,\r\n",
      "\"it means skib, skib, skibble--de--de--dosh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this she had her mother by the shoulders and was seeking to kiss the\r\n",
      "affrighted and appalled face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Theodora escaped her, and realized that a changeling had indeed entered\r\n",
      "her home. An unknown element was here. It was as if, having been\r\n",
      "discovered, Priscilla felt she no longer needed to hide her inner self,\r\n",
      "but was giving it full sway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If they could only have known that the spring of imagination and joy\r\n",
      "had been touched in the girl and merely the madness of youth and the\r\n",
      "legitimate yearning for expression moved her! But Theodora did not\r\n",
      "understand and she tried to be stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are to be back in this house at four!\" she cried; \"at quarter after\r\n",
      "at the latest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Priscilla started forth. The mother watched her from the doorway.\r\n",
      "Suspicion was in her heart; she feared the girl would turn toward the\r\n",
      "woods; she was prepared for that, but instead, the flying figure made for\r\n",
      "the grassy road leading to Kenmore and was soon lost to sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three miles of level road, much of it smooth, moss-covered rock, was\r\n",
      "easy travelling for nimble feet and a glad heart. And Priscilla was\r\n",
      "the gladdest creature afield that day. Impishly she was enjoying the\r\n",
      "sensation she had created. It appealed to her dramatic sense and animal\r\n",
      "enjoyment. In some subtle fashion she realized she had balked and\r\n",
      "defeated her father--she was rather sorry about her mother--but that\r\n",
      "could be remedied later on. There was no doubt that she had the whip hand\r\n",
      "of Nathaniel at last, and the subconscious attitude of defiance she\r\n",
      "always held toward her father was strengthened by the knowledge that\r\n",
      "he was unjustly judging her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were many things of interest in Kenmore that only limited time\r\n",
      "prevented Priscilla from investigating. She longed to go to the jail and\r\n",
      "see if the people had prevailed upon old Jerry McAlpin to discharge\r\n",
      "himself. She admired Jerry's spirit!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wanted to call upon Mrs. Hornby and question her about Jamsie, her\r\n",
      "last boy, who had succumbed to the lure of the States. She longed to know\r\n",
      "the symptoms of one attacked by the lure. Then there was the White Fish\r\n",
      "Lodge--she did so want to visit Mrs. McAdam. The annual menace of taking\r\n",
      "Mrs. McAdams' license from her was man's talk just then, and Mrs. McAdam\r\n",
      "was so splendid when her rights were threatened. On the village Green\r\n",
      "she annually defended her position like a born orator. Priscilla had\r\n",
      "heard her once and had never got over her admiration for the little, thin\r\n",
      "woman who rallied the men to her support with frantic threats as to her\r\n",
      "handling of their rights unless they helped her fight her battle against\r\n",
      "a government bent upon taking the living from a \"God-be-praised\r\n",
      "widow-woman with two sons to support.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had all been so exactly to Priscilla's dramatic taste that she with\r\n",
      "difficulty restrained herself from calling at the White Fish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a good hour to her credit when the erranding was finished and\r\n",
      "the time needed for the home run set aside, so to the little cabin, built\r\n",
      "beside the schoolhouse, she went with heavily loaded arms and an\r\n",
      "astonishingly light heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Since the day when Anton Farwell had undertaken Priscilla's\r\n",
      "enlightenment, asserting that he had been ordained to do so by her god,\r\n",
      "he had had an almost supernatural influence upon her thought. For her,\r\n",
      "he was endowed with mystery, and, with the subtle poetry of the lonely\r\n",
      "young, she deafened her ears to any normal explanation of the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reaching the cabin, she pushed gently against the door, knowing that if\r\n",
      "it opened, Kenmore was free to enter. Farwell was in and, when Priscilla\r\n",
      "stood near him, seemed to travel back from a far place before he saw her.\r\n",
      "Farwell was an old-young man; he cultivated the appearance of age, but\r\n",
      "only the very youthful were deceived. His long, dark hair fell about his\r\n",
      "thin face lankly, and it was an easy matter, by dropping his head, to\r\n",
      "hide his features completely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was tall and, from much stooping over books or the work of his garden,\r\n",
      "was round-shouldered. When he looked you fully in the face, which he\r\n",
      "rarely did, it was noticed that his eyes were at once childishly friendly\r\n",
      "and deathly sad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The older people of Kenmore had ceased to wonder about him. Having\r\n",
      "accepted him, they let matters drop. To the children, to all helpless\r\n",
      "animals, he was an enduring solace and power. When all else failed they\r\n",
      "looked to him for solution. For this had Priscilla come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To be sure!\" cried Farwell at length. \"It's Priscilla Glenn. Bad child!\r\n",
      "It's many a day since we had a lesson. There! there! no excuses. Sit down\r\n",
      "and--own up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While he was speaking Farwell replenished the wood on the fire and\r\n",
      "brushed the ashes from the hearth. Priscilla, in a chair, sat upright and\r\n",
      "rather breathlessly wondered how she could manage all she wanted to say\r\n",
      "and hear in the small space of time that was hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anton's back was toward her when she uttered her first question and the\r\n",
      "words brought him to an upright position, facing her at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Farwell, where did you come from--I mean before the wreck?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment the master looked as if about to spring forward to lock the\r\n",
      "door and bar the windows. Real alarm was in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who told you to ask that?\" he whispered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No one. No one has to tell me questions; I have more of my own than I\r\n",
      "can ask. I never thought before about you, Mr. Farwell, we're so used to\r\n",
      "you, but now it's because of _me_. I want to know. Somebody has got to\r\n",
      "help me--I feel it coming again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Feel what coming?\" Farwell sat limply down in the chair he had lately\r\n",
      "occupied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, the lure. It comes to the boys, Mr. Farwell. They just get it and\r\n",
      "go off to the States, and it's come to me! I've always known it would.\r\n",
      "You see, I've got to go away; not just now, but some time. I'm going out\r\n",
      "through the Secret Portage. I'm going away, away to find my real place.\r\n",
      "I'm going to do something--out where the States are. I hoped you came\r\n",
      "from there; could tell me--how to go about it. Do you know, I feel as if\r\n",
      "I had been dropped in Kenmore just to rest before I went on!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell looked at the girl and something new and changed about her\r\n",
      "startled him as it had her parents, but, being wiser, he felt no\r\n",
      "antagonism. It was an amazing, an interesting thing. The girl had\r\n",
      "suddenly developed: that was all. She was eager to try her wings at a\r\n",
      "longer flight than any of her sex in Kenmore had ever before dreamed. It\r\n",
      "was amusing even if it were serious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Years before, Farwell had discovered the girl's keen mind and her\r\n",
      "quaint originality. As much for his own pleasure as her advantage he\r\n",
      "had taught her as he had some of the other village children, erratically,\r\n",
      "inconsequently, and here she was now demanding that he fit her out with\r\n",
      "a chart for deep-sea sailing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How could he permit her to harbour, even for an idle moment, the idea of\r\n",
      "leaving her shelter and going away? At this the thin, dark face grew\r\n",
      "rigid and stern. But too well the man knew the folly of setting up active\r\n",
      "opposition to any young thing straining against the door of a cage.\r\n",
      "Better open the door even if a string on the leg or a clipped wing had\r\n",
      "to be resorted to!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did you ever see the States?\" The tense voice was imploring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. Why do you wish to go there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do the boys?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was baffling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, there was Mrs. Hornby's oldest boy, he went to the States, got the\r\n",
      "worst of it, and came home to die. He did not find them happy places.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but all the other Hornbys went just the same, even Jamsie. It's the\r\n",
      "chance, you know, the chance to try what's in you, even if you _do_ come\r\n",
      "home and die! You never have a chance in Kenmore; and I don't mean to be\r\n",
      "like my mother--like the other women. You see, Mr. Farwell, I'm willing\r\n",
      "to suffer, but I _am_ going to know all I want to, and I am going to find\r\n",
      "a place where I fit in, if I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So small and ignorant did the girl look, yet so determined and keen, that\r\n",
      "Farwell grew anxious. Evidently Nathaniel had borne too hard upon her,\r\n",
      "borne to the snapping point, and she had, in her wild fashion, caught the\r\n",
      "infection of the last going away--Jamsie Hornby's. It was laughable, but\r\n",
      "pathetic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What could you do?\" Farwell leaned forward and gazed into the strange\r\n",
      "blue eyes fixed upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dance. Have you ever seen me dance? Do you want to?\" She was prepared to\r\n",
      "prove herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good Lord! no, no!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! I can dance. If some one would play for me--play on--on a fiddle, I\r\n",
      "could dance all day and night. Wouldn't people pay for that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was serious business. By some subtle suggestion Priscilla Glenn had\r\n",
      "introduced into the bare, cleanly room an atmosphere of danger, a curious\r\n",
      "sense of unreality and excitement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--they do pay,\" Farwell said slowly; \"but where in heaven's name did\r\n",
      "you get such ideas?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl looked impishly saucy. She was making a sensation again and,\r\n",
      "while Anton Farwell was not affected as her parents had been, he was\r\n",
      "undoubtedly impressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's this way: You have to sell what you've got until you get something\r\n",
      "better. There isn't an earthly thing I can do but dance now; of course I\r\n",
      "can learn. Don't you remember the nice story about the old woman who went\r\n",
      "to market her eggs for to sell? Master Farwell, I'm like her, and my\r\n",
      "dancing is my--egg!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was laughing now, this unreasoning, unreasonable girl, and she was\r\n",
      "laughing more at Farwell's perplexity than at her own glibness. She must\r\n",
      "soon go, her time was growing short, but she was enjoying herself\r\n",
      "immensely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking at her, Farwell was suddenly convinced of one overpowering fact:\r\n",
      "Priscilla Glenn was destined for--living! Hers was one of those natures\r\n",
      "that flash now and then upon a commonplace existence, a strange soul from\r\n",
      "an unknown port, never resting until it finds its way back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Poor little girl!\" whispered Farwell, and then he talked to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would she let him go to her father and mother?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the use?\" questioned Priscilla, and she told him of the\r\n",
      "experience in the woods. \"Father saw only evil when it was the most\r\n",
      "beautiful thing that ever happened.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell saw a wider stretch and more danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I will try, and anyway, Priscilla, if I promise to help you get\r\n",
      "ready, will you promise me to do nothing without consulting me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This the girl was ready enough to do. She was restless and defiant under\r\n",
      "her new emotion, but intuitively she had sought Farwell because he had\r\n",
      "before aided her and sympathized with her. Yes, she would confide in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night Farwell called at Lonely Farm. Followed by his two lean, ugly\r\n",
      "sledge dogs he made his way to the barn where Nathaniel was doing the\r\n",
      "evening's work. While the men talked, the dogs, behind the building,\r\n",
      "fought silently and ferociously. Farwell had fed one before he left home\r\n",
      "and a bitter jealousy lay between the animals. It was almost more than\r\n",
      "one might hope that the master could influence Glenn or change his mind,\r\n",
      "but Farwell did bring to bear an argument that, because nothing else\r\n",
      "presented itself, swayed the father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You cannot get the same results from all children,\" Farwell said,\r\n",
      "looking afar and smiling grimly; \"there's no use trying to make an\r\n",
      "abnormal child into a normal one. Priscilla is like a wild thing of the\r\n",
      "woods. You may tame her, if you go about it right; you'll never be able\r\n",
      "to force her. She's kind and affectionate, but she cannot be fettered or\r\n",
      "caged, without mischief being done. Better let her think she is having\r\n",
      "her own way, or--she may take it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll break her will!\" muttered Glenn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And if you do--what then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll fall into line--women do! Their life takes it out of them. Once I\r\n",
      "get her on the right track, she'll go straight enough. There's no other\r\n",
      "way for her sex, thank God!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'd be a poor, despicable thing if she was cowed.\" Contempt rang in\r\n",
      "Farwell's voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'd serve her purpose.\" Glenn was so angry that he became brutal.\r\n",
      "\"Spirit ain't needed for her job.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Purpose? Job?\" Farwell repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Child-bearing; husband-serving. If they take to it naturally\r\n",
      "they're all the better off; if they have to be brought to terms--well,\r\n",
      "then----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gradually the truth dawned upon Farwell, and his thin face flushed, while\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish I'd kept to my first ideas!\" Glenn was saying surlily, \"and never\r\n",
      "let the limb learn of you or another. I gave her her head and here we\r\n",
      "are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Had she been taught regularly by some one better fitted than I she would\r\n",

      "imagination.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this Glenn made no response, but the energy with which he applied the\r\n",
      "brush to his horse caused the animal to rear dangerously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, come,\" Farwell continued; \"better loosen the rein and let her run\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But there's good, plain law. I'd have her back and well cowed, if she\r\n",
      "attempted that!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then Farwell played his card.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hell! Of course there is law and of course you have the whip hand while\r\n",
      "Priscilla is in your clutch, but with a wit like hers, if she slipped\r\n",
      "across the border she could lose herself so completely that neither your\r\n",
      "hate nor legal power could ever find her. Do you want to drive her to\r\n",
      "such lengths?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of the truth of what Farwell was saying dashed Glenn's temper with\r\n",
      "fear. Hard and cruel as he was, he was not devoid of affection of a\r\n",
      "clammy sort, and for an instant Priscilla as a helpless girl wandering\r\n",
      "among strangers replaced Priscilla, the rebellious daughter, and pity\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Simply this: You can trust me. Good Lord you surely can trust me with\r\n",
      "her! Let me teach her and bring a little diversion into her life. What\r\n",
      "she wants is what all young things want--freedom and fun--pure, simple\r\n",

      "learn of Farwell what Farwell chose to give her, and, for the first time\r\n",
      "in the girl's life, she felt a glow of appreciation toward her father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this new freedom she became happier, less restless, and her\r\n",
      "admiration for Farwell knew no bounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The schoolmaster managed to procure a violin and laboriously practised\r\n",
      "upon it until an almost forgotten gift was somewhat restored. He did not\r\n",
      "play as Travers did--he had only his ear to depend upon; he had never\r\n",
      "been well taught--but his music sufficed to accompany Priscilla's nimble\r\n",

      "Mrs. McAdam of the White Fish Lodge came out upon the village Green one\r\n",
      "evening in late August and, in a loud voice, hailed Jerry McAlpin:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've heard it said,\" called she, \"that you, you Jerry McAlpin, are not\r\n",
      "against the taking away of my license; not against the making of Kenmore\r\n",
      "a teetotal town!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was menace in the high-pitched voice; warning in the accusation.\r\n",
      "But Jerry had not taken a drop to drink since his self-releasement from\r\n",
      "jail (after an apology from Hornby), and he was uncannily clear headed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've said that same!\" he replied, and stopped short in his walk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two or three other men, followed by dogs, paused to listen. Then a boat,\r\n",
      "coming in loaded with fish, tied up to the wharf, and the crew, leaning\r\n",
      "over the sides, waited for developments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And for why?\" called Mary, hands on hips and her sharp eyes blazing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For this: The drink turns us mad! I'm late finding it out, but I've\r\n",
      "found it! It sent me to jail with my wits all afire. My boy drank that\r\n",
      "night, drank like a young beast, and lay on the floor of the cabin, they\r\n",
      "tell me, after I went away; and he only sixteen, and his dead uncle stark\r\n",
      "there beside him for company!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time a goodly gathering was on the Green, and Mary was in her\r\n",
      "element.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And so,\" she said calmly, waxing eloquent as her power grew, \"you and\r\n",
      "the like of you would take an honest woman's living from her, and she\r\n",
      "a God-be-praised widow at that, because you can't control the beast in\r\n",
      "yourselves and can't train the cubs of your kennels!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was going to great lengths, and many a listener who sided with Mary\r\n",
      "was chilled by her offensive words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come! come!\" warned Hornby, the father of the recently lured Jamsie,\r\n",
      "\"them ain't exactly womanly terms, are they?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary was on her high horse. Availing herself of the safety her sex\r\n",
      "secured for her, she struck left and right without grace or favour, and\r\n",
      "her audience gaped while they listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I know! 'Tis this year a dry town with me ruined, and it's next year\r\n",
      "a wet town with McAlpin, Hornby, or another creature in trousers taking\r\n",
      "my place; and after that there will be no more dry town for ever and\r\n",
      "ever! It's not morals you are after, but a man-controlled tavern. Blast\r\n",
      "ye!\" A sneer marked Mary's thin, dark face. \"You want your drinks and\r\n",
      "your freedom, but you say you fear for your lads. Shame on you! Have\r\n",
      "I no lads?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have I not trained them in the way they should go? Do I fear for them?\"\r\n",
      "A grave silence, and McAlpin glared at Hornby, while an irreverent youth,\r\n",
      "with a fish dangling from his hands, laughed and muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Like gorrems!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Play a man's part, Jerry McAlpin. 'Tis not for Jerry-Jo you fear; it's\r\n",
      "my business you'd get from me, and you know it! Teach that lad of yours\r\n",
      "to be decent, as I've trained mine. I have no fear for my boys! I know\r\n",
      "what I'm talking about, and I tell you now, if my lads were like yours\r\n",
      "I'd fling the business over, but I don't see why a decent woman, and her\r\n",
      "a God-be-praised widow, should lose her living because you can't train\r\n",
      "your brats in the way they should go. But this is mine! If you don't\r\n",
      "stand by me and swear to do it here and now, it's not another drink one\r\n",
      "of you shall get in my place till after things are settled.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was going farther than Mary McAdam had ever gone before. She had\r\n",
      "threatened dire restrictions against them who failed to support her cause\r\n",
      "should her cause be won in spite of them; she had even hinted at cash\r\n",
      "payments to insure her against want if, possibly, her license was\r\n",
      "revoked, but this shutting down upon human rights before election came\r\n",
      "off was upsetting to the last degree. Hornby looked at McAlpin and\r\n",
      "McAlpin dropped his eyes; there was a muttering and a grumbling, and a\r\n",
      "general feeling prevailed that every man should be his own keeper and\r\n",
      "the guardian of his own sons, and it would be a bitter wrong against a\r\n",
      "God-be-praised widow to let family affairs ruin her business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the end Mary McAdam, with a manly following of stern upholders of\r\n",
      "individual rights and the opportunity for mutual good fellowship, retired\r\n",
      "to the bar of the White Fish and, waited upon by Mary herself and her two\r\n",
      "exemplary sons, made merry far into the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom and Sandy McAdam, handsome, carefree boys of sixteen and eighteen,\r\n",
      "passed the drinks with many a jest and often a wink, but never a drop\r\n",
      "drank they, not until the Lodge had closed its doors on all visitors, and\r\n",
      "then Tom, the elder, with a final leer at Sandy the younger, drained off\r\n",
      "a glass of bad whisky with a grace that betokened long practice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hold, there!\" cautioned Sandy, filling a glass of beer for himself;\r\n",
      "\"you'll not be able to hide it from the mother, you galoot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, the night's long before the day breaks, and it's yourself as must\r\n",
      "take the turn at house chores the morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The following day was cloudy and threatening, and why Mary McAdam should\r\n",
      "take that time for suggesting that her boys go over to Wyland Island and\r\n",
      "buy their winter suits, she herself could not have told. Perhaps, from\r\n",
      "the assurance of last night, she felt freer with money; perhaps she\r\n",
      "thought the boys could not be spared so well later; be that as it might,\r\n",
      "she insisted, even against Sandy's remark that \"a lad couldn't put his\r\n",
      "mind to a winter outfit with the sweat rolling down his back,\" that they\r\n",
      "should set forth by eleven o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Make a lark of it,\" said she generously; \"take that scapegoat Jerry-Jo\r\n",
      "McAlpin with you and have it out with him about being a young beast and\r\n",
      "worrying the heart out of old Jerry, who means well but ain't got no kind\r\n",
      "of a headpiece. Take your lunch along and----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here she pointed her remarks with a lean, commanding finger: \"You take\r\n",
      "that sail off the launch! It's quiet enough now, but it ain't going to\r\n",
      "last forever, and I couldn't rest with three flighty lads in a boat with\r\n",
      "a sail _and_ an engine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. McAdam always expected to be obeyed. Her personality was such that\r\n",
      "she generally was; but always, when disobedience followed, it was hidden\r\n",
      "from her immediate attention, and she was never one to show the weakness\r\n",
      "of watching to see her orders carried out. That was why she, of all the\r\n",
      "people in the little village, did not realize that her boys often drank\r\n",
      "more than was good for them--always managed, by clever devices, to escape\r\n",
      "her eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A glass of harmless stuff now and again,\" she would say with a toss of\r\n",
      "her head; \"what's that but a proof of the lads' self-control? That's what\r\n",
      "I'm a-telling you: make your lads strong and self-respecting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom did not take the sail from the boat that day, neither did he expect\r\n",
      "to use it. He furled it close and shipped it carefully, but it was late,\r\n",
      "and, in the last hurry, he kept his mother's caution in mind, but did not\r\n",
      "carry out her command. Then Sandy, when they were about to start, did a\r\n",
      "bold thing. Stealing into the bar, he took a bottle of whisky and a\r\n",
      "bottle of brandy; these he hid under his reefer, and, with a laugh at his\r\n",
      "own cunning, put into the empty places on the shelves two partly filled\r\n",
      "bottles, and ran to the wharf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary McAdam waved them a farewell from the steps. She had packed the\r\n",
      "hamper and stowed it under the very sail she had ordered off. In the\r\n",
      "excitement of preparation she overlooked it entirely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You, Sandy, see to it that you buy a suit that you won't repent when the\r\n",
      "winter nips you!\" she called.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you, Tom, get a quiet colour and _no_ checks! When yer last year's\r\n",
      "suit shrank and the squares got crooked ye looked like a damaged\r\n",
      "checker-board!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo McAlpin from his seat in the stern roared with laughter at this,\r\n",
      "and just then the sturdy little engine puffed, thudded, and \"caught on,\"\r\n",
      "and off went the three with loud words of good-bye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Channel was as smooth as a summer brook, and the launch shot ahead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a bit chilly,\" Sandy said as they neared the mouth opening at\r\n",
      "Flying Point into the Little Bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Put on your storm coat,\" cautioned Tom, \"and you, too, Jerry-Jo; we'll\r\n",
      "get the wind when we pass Dreamer's Rock and strike the Big Bay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys got out their coats and put them on, and then Sandy said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See what I've got! Snitched it from under the mother's eye, too!\" He\r\n",
      "held up the bottles. Tom laughed, but Jerry-Jo reached out for one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A nip will ward off the cold better than a coat,\" he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all three indulged in this preventive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beyond Dreamer's Rock the wind fulfilled Tom's prophecy; it was not a\r\n",
      "great wind, but it was a steady one, and, perhaps, because the whisky had\r\n",
      "warmed Tom's blood too hastily and hotly, he grew reckless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you say, fellows, to eating our lunch and then trying sail and\r\n",
      "engine together? We could beat the record and surprise folks by our time\r\n",
      "in coming and going. The wind's safe; not a puff! What do you say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo was something of a coward, but by the time he had eaten his\r\n",
      "lunch and washed it down with more whisky than he had meant to take, he\r\n",
      "was ready to handle the sail himself and proceeded to do so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Little Bear Island was the last one before the entrance to Big Bay, and\r\n",
      "when the launch passed that, either the wind had changed, or Tom, at the\r\n",
      "engine and Jerry-Jo at the sail, had lost nerve and head, for the boat\r\n",
      "became unmanageable. Sandy, keeping to the exact middle of the boat,\r\n",
      "called to Jerry-Jo to lower the sail, but Jerry-Jo did not hear, or\r\n",
      "failed to clearly comprehend. The little craft shot ahead like an arrow,\r\n",
      "but Tom knew that when they went about there would be trouble. They were\r\n",
      "fully a mile from either rock-bound shore. Wyland Island was a good two\r\n",
      "miles before them, and home seven miles to the rear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A biggish sea was rolling and the sky was clouding threateningly. The\r\n",
      "liquor had done its worst for the boys: it had unnerved them, while at\r\n",
      "the same time it had given them a mad courage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Keep straight ahead,\" shouted Tom, \"until we get near shore, and then\r\n",
      "pull in that infernal sail!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What happened just then Jerry-Jo could never tell, and he alone remained\r\n",
      "at the day's end for the telling!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were in the water, all three of them! For a moment Jerry-Jo,\r\n",
      "thoroughly sobered and keener witted than he had ever been before in his\r\n",
      "life, believed he was the only one of the party ever again to appear in\r\n",
      "that angry sea. Then he saw the over-turned boat, heard the last sobbing\r\n",
      "pants of the engine as it filled with water; then Tom's black head and\r\n",
      "agonized face appeared; then Sandy's red head. They all made for the boat\r\n",
      "and the wide sail lying flat in the water!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They reached the launch, chilled and desperate, climbed upon it, and\r\n",
      "gazed helplessly at each other. Through chattering teeth they tried to\r\n",
      "speak, but only a moan escaped Tom's blue lips. The wind was colder; the\r\n",
      "sun had gone behind a bank of dull storm clouds. After a long while\r\n",
      "Sandy, looking over the expanse of ugly choppy waves, shuddered and\r\n",
      "panted:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's going to be dark soon; it can't be more than a half mile to yonder\r\n",
      "rock--I'm for swimming to it! Once on land we can move about, get our\r\n",
      "blood going, and perhaps find a sheltered spot--till--morning!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom looked at his brother vaguely; he was suffering keenly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be a fool!\" he shuddered. Jerry-Jo, huddled in a wet heap, was\r\n",
      "sobbing like a baby--gone utterly to pieces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another hideous space of silence followed, then Sandy spoke again:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm going to make the try. I'm dying of cold. It's the only chance for\r\n",
      "any of us. Here goes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And before any one could interfere he made his leap and was in the water,\r\n",
      "a bobbing speck among the ugly white caps!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good God!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was all Tom said, but his crazed eyes were upon that strained,\r\n",
      "uplifted face. Jerry-Jo ceased his moaning and--laughed! It was a foolish\r\n",
      "cackle, such as a maniac might give, mistaking a death-struggle for a bit\r\n",
      "of play.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's--a good swimmer!\" he gasped, and laughed again. Tom turned, for an\r\n",
      "instant, wondering eyes upon him. He may have, in that moment, estimated\r\n",
      "his own chance, his duty to Jerry-Jo, and his determination to be with\r\n",
      "his brother. The perplexed gaze lasted but the briefest space of time and\r\n",
      "then with:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All right! here goes!\" he was making for Sandy with a strength born of\r\n",
      "despair and madness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come back!\" shrieked Jerry-Jo with the frenzy of one deserted and too\r\n",
      "cowardly or helpless to follow: \"Come back!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But neither swimmer heard nor heeded. For a moment more the black and the\r\n",
      "red heads bobbed about, the faces turned toward each other grimly. Even\r\n",
      "in that waste and at the bitter last the sense of companionship held\r\n",
      "their thought. Jerry-Jo, rigid and every sense at last alert in an effort\r\n",
      "for self-preservation, saw Sandy smile. It was a wonderful smile: it was\r\n",
      "like a flash of sunlight on that black sea; then Sandy's lips moved, but\r\n",
      "no one was ever to know what he said, and then--Jerry-Jo was alone in the\r\n",
      "coming night and the rolling waves!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They should,\" said Mary McAdam, \"be home by seven at the latest. The\r\n",

      "Anton Farwell sat on the steps of the Lodge, his dogs peacefully lying at\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"They certainly do. The more you live with dumb creatures, the more you\r\n",

      "clock's a bit slow at that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell felt sure it was a good ten minutes slow; but because of that he\r\n",
      "turned the conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jerry McAlpin was telling me to-day,\" he said in his low, pleasant\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"My man and Jerry, with old Michael McAlpin, were the freest of\r\n",
      "smugglers. In them days the McAlpins wasn't pestered with feelings; they\r\n",
      "was good sports. Jerry marrying that full-breed had it taken out of him\r\n",
      "somewhat--she was a hifty one. Them Indians never can get off their high\r\n",
      "heels--not the full-breeds. But I tell you, Mr. Farwell, and you take it\r\n",
      "for truth, when Jerry begins to maudle about repentance, it's just before\r\n",
      "a--debauch. I know the signs.\"\r\n",

      "the stuff on the cart and were coming down the road back of the Far Hill\r\n",
      "Place when they sensed the custom men in the bushes. What do they do but\r\n",
      "cut the traces and lick the horses into a run; then they turned the\r\n",
      "barrels loose, jumped off, letting them roll down the hill, and they,\r\n",
      "themselves, made for safety. It was only a bit more trouble to go back in\r\n",
      "a week's time and gather up the barrels; but those government devils\r\n",

      "them! But when they saw they had _only_ the horses, oh! good Lord!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell laughed absently; his eyes were fixed on the water. Even in the\r\n",
      "Channel it had an angry look. The current was set from the Bay, and the\r\n",
      "stream rose and fell as if it had an ugly secret in its keeping.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "His dogs leaped to him and then made for the Green. Without another word\r\n",
      "Farwell walked to his launch at the foot of the wharf steps and prepared\r\n",
      "for his trip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A black wave of fear enveloped Mary McAdam. She was overcome by a\r\n",
      "certainty of evil, and, when Farwell's boat had disappeared, she strode\r\n",
      "to the Green and gave vent to her anxiety. There were those who\r\n",
      "comforted, those who jeered, but the men were largely away on fishing\r\n",
      "business, and the women and boys were more interested in her excitement\r\n",
      "than they were in her cause for fear.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Was Jerry-Jo with your boys, Mrs. McAdam?\" he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He was that! And Jerry-Jo always brings ill-luck on a trip. I should\r\n",
      "have known better than to let the half-breed scamp go. 'Twas pity as\r\n",
      "moved me. Jerry-Jo is one as thinks rocking a boat is spirit, and yelling\r\n",
      "for help, when no help is needed, a rare joke. The young devil!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Doctor Ledyard and Dick stayed on after getting the mail. A strange,\r\n",
      "tense feeling was growing in the place. Mary's terror was contagious.\r\n",

      "send the lot of them out after the young limbs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At eight-thirty the storm broke. A dull, thick storm which had used most\r\n",
      "of its fury out beyond Flying Point, and in the breast of the sullen wind\r\n",
      "came the sound of an engine panting, panting in the darkness that was\r\n",
      "shot by flashes of lightning and rent by thunder-claps. Mary McAdam gazed\r\n",
      "petrified at Bounder, who had followed her to the Green.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why don't yer yelp?\" she muttered, giving the dog a kick. But Bounder\r\n",
      "blinked indifferently as the coming boat drew near and nearer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every boy, woman, and child, with the old men and lazy young ones, were\r\n",
      "at the wharf when the launch emerged from the darkness. Some one was\r\n",
      "standing up guiding the boat, ready to protect it from violent contact;\r\n",
      "some one was huddled on the floor of the boat--some one who made no cry,\r\n",
      "did not look up. They two were all! Just then a lurid flash of lightning\r\n",
      "seemed to photograph the scene forever on the minds of the onlookers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ledyard, with Dick, was close to the boat when it touched the dock. By\r\n",
      "the lurid light of electricity the face of the man in the launch rose\r\n",
      "sharply against the darkness and for one instant shone as if to attract\r\n",
      "attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell was known by reputation to the doctor; he had probably been seen\r\n",
      "by him many times, but certainly his face had never made an impression\r\n",
      "upon him before. But now, in the hour of anguish and excitement, it held\r\n",
      "Ledyard's thought to the exclusion of everything else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "sense was alert, he knew!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jerry-Jo!\" Dick was calling, \"where are the others?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a mad question, but the boy, huddling in the launch, replied\r\n",
      "quiveringly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gone! gone to the bottom off Dreamer's Rock.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he began to whimper piteously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shuddering cry rang out. It was Mary McAdam, who, followed by her dog,\r\n",
      "ran wildly, apron over head, toward the White Fish Lodge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell, casting all reserve aside, worked with Ledyard over the\r\n",
      "prostrate Jerry-Jo. The recognition was no shock to him; he had always\r\n",
      "known Ledyard; had cleverly kept from his notice heretofore, but now the\r\n",
      "one thing he had hoped to escape was upon him, and he grew strangely\r\n",
      "indifferent to what lay before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He obeyed every command of the doctor as they sought to restore Jerry-Jo.\r\n",
      "More than once their eyes met and their hands touched, but the contact\r\n",
      "did not cause a tremor in either man.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The bay was dragged, various methods being used, but the bodies of Sandy\r\n",
      "and Tom McAdam were not recovered. Mary McAdam with strained eyes and\r\n",
      "rigid lips waited at the wharf as each party returned, and when at last\r\n",
      "hope died in her poor heart, she set about the doing of two things that\r\n",
      "she felt must be done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The behaviour of the boys in the boat on the day of the accident had at\r\n",
      "last reached her ears, for, with such excitement prevailing and Jerry-Jo\r\n",
      "reduced to periods of nervous babbling as he repeated again and again the\r\n",
      "story, Mary was certain of overhearing the details. As far as possible\r\n",
      "she verified every word. That her sons had disobeyed her about the sail\r\n",
      "there could be no doubt, and when she went to the shelf of the bar and\r\n",
      "discovered the half-filled bottles which Sandy had put in the places of\r\n",
      "the brandy and whisky, her heart gave up doubt. She relinquished all that\r\n",
      "she had prided herself upon in the past. They had defied and deceived\r\n",
      "her! They had permitted her to be mocked while she prated of her\r\n",
      "superiority! It was bitter hard, but Mary McAdam made no feeble cry--she\r\n",
      "prepared for the final act in the little drama. Beyond that she could\r\n",
      "not, would not look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dig me two graves,\" she commanded Big Hornby; \"dig them one on either\r\n",
      "side of my husband's.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll be thinking the bodies will yet be found, poor soul?\" Hornby had\r\n",
      "a tender nature kept human by his hunger for his absent boys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not thinking. I'm doing my part; let others do the same.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then Mary went to Anton Farwell. Farwell, since the night of the\r\n",
      "tragedy, was waiting, always waiting for the inevitable. Every knock at\r\n",
      "his door brought him panting to his feet. He knew Doctor Ledyard would\r\n",
      "come; he fervently hoped he would, and soon, but the days dragged on.\r\n",
      "There were moments when the man had a wild desire to shoulder his bag and\r\n",
      "set forth under shadow of the night and the excitement, for one of his\r\n",
      "long absences, this one, however, to terminate as far from Kenmore as\r\n",
      "possible. Once he had even started, but at the edge of the water where\r\n",
      "his boat lay he halted, deterred by the knowledge that his safer course\r\n",
      "lay in facing what he must face sooner or later. Now that he was known to\r\n",
      "be alive it were easier to deal with one man than with the pack of\r\n",
      "bloodhounds which that one man might set upon him. Always the personal\r\n",
      "element entered in--it was weak hope, but the only one. He might win\r\n",
      "Ledyard; he could not win the pack!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mary McAdam knocked on Farwell's door he thought the time had come,\r\n",
      "but the sight of the distracted mother steadied him. Here was something\r\n",
      "for him to do, something to carry him away from his lonely forebodings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come in, Mrs. McAdam. Rest yourself. You look sorely in need of rest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the early evening of a hot day. It was lighter out of doors than\r\n",
      "in the cottage, for the shades were drawn at Farwell's windows; he\r\n",
      "disliked the idea of being watched from without.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't rest, Master Farwell, till I've done my task,\" said the poor\r\n",
      "soul, sinking into the nearest chair. \"And it's to get your help I've\r\n",
      "come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll do what I can,\" murmured Farwell. \"What I'll be permitted to do,\"\r\n",
      "he felt would be more true.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've said more than once, Mr. Farwell, that were my boys like other boys\r\n",
      "I'd give up the business of the White Fish. Well, my lads were like\r\n",
      "others, only they were keener about deceiving me. I thought I'd made them\r\n",
      "strong and sure, but I did the same hurt to my flesh and blood that I did\r\n",
      "to others. I put evil too close and easy to them. I prided myself on what\r\n",
      "I had never done! They'll come back to me no more. Could I have a talk\r\n",
      "with them, things might be straightened out; but I must do what is to be\r\n",
      "done alone.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a quiver shook the low, severe voice. The very hardness moved Farwell\r\n",
      "to deep pity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's now, Mr. Farwell, that I'd have you come to the Lodge and help me\r\n",
      "with my task, and when it's over I want you to stand with me beside those\r\n",
      "two empty graves and say what you can for them who never had the right\r\n",
      "mother to teach them. I'm no church woman; the job of priest and minister\r\n",
      "sickens me, but I know a good man when I see one. You helped the lads\r\n",
      "while they lived; you risked your life to help them home at the last; and\r\n",
      "it's you who shall consecrate the empty beds where I'd have my lads lie\r\n",
      "if the power were mine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell got up and paced the room restlessly. Suddenly, with Ledyard's\r\n",
      "recognition, the poor shell of respectability and self-respect which,\r\n",
      "during his lonely years, had grown about him, was torn asunder, and he\r\n",
      "was what he knew the doctor believed him. To such, Mary McAdam's request\r\n",
      "seemed a cruel jest, a taunt to drive him into the open. And yet he knew\r\n",
      "that up to the last ditch he must hold to what he had secured for\r\n",
      "himself--the trust and friendship of these simple people. Hard and\r\n",
      "distasteful as the effort was he dared not turn himself from it. Full\r\n",
      "well he knew that Ledyard's magnifying glass was, unseen, being used\r\n",
      "against him even now. The delay was probably caused by the doctor's\r\n",
      "silent investigation of his recent life, his daily deeds. He could well\r\n",
      "imagine the amusement, contempt, and disbelief that would meet the story\r\n",
      "of his poor, blameless years during which he had played with children,\r\n",
      "worked in his garden, been friends with the common folk, not from any\r\n",
      "high motive, but to keep himself from insanity! He had had to use any\r\n",
      "material at hand, and it had brought about certain results that Ledyard\r\n",
      "would dissect and toss aside, he would never believe! Still the attempt\r\n",
      "to live on, as he had lived, must be undertaken. A kind of desperation\r\n",
      "overcame him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What did it matter? He might just as well go on until he was stopped. He\r\n",
      "was no safer, no more comfortable, sitting apart waiting for his summons.\r\n",
      "He would, as far as in him lay, ignore the menacing thing that hovered\r\n",
      "near, and play the part of a man while he might.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm ready to go with you, Mrs. McAdam,\" he said, turning for his hat,\r\n",
      "\"and as we go tell me what you are about to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was no easy telling. The mere statement of fact was so crude that\r\n",
      "Farwell could not, by any possibility, comprehend the dramatic scene he\r\n",
      "was soon to witness and partake of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm going to keep my word,\" Mary McAdam explained. \"I'll not be waiting\r\n",
      "for the license to be given, or taken away, I'll keep my word.\"\r\n",

      "It was a still, breathless night, with a moon nearly full, and as Mrs.\r\n",
      "McAdam, accompanied by Farwell, passed over the Green toward the Lodge,\r\n",
      "the idlers and loiterers followed after at a respectful distance. Mary\r\n",
      "was the centre of attraction just then, and Farwell always commanded\r\n",
      "attention, used as the people were to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come on! come on!\" called Mary without turning her head. \"Bring others\r\n",

      "the need for the keeping is over!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A growing excitement was rising in Mary's voice; she was nearing the end\r\n",
      "of her endurance and was becoming reckless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the time the Lodge was reached a goodly crowd was at the steps leading\r\n",
      "up to the bar. Jerry McAlpin was there with Jerry-Jo beside him. Hornby,\r\n",
      "just come from the digging of the two graves, stood nearby with the scent\r\n",
      "of fresh earth clinging to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly Mary McAdam came out of the house, her arms filled with bottles,\r\n",
      "while behind her followed Farwell rolling a cask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What occurred then was so surprising and bewildering that those who\r\n",
      "looked on were never able to clearly describe the scene. Standing with\r\n",
      "her load, Mary McAdam spoke fierce, hot words. She showed herself no\r\n",
      "mercy, asked for no pity. She had dealt in a business that threatened the\r\n",
      "souls of men and boys, made harder the lives of women. She had blinded\r\n",
      "herself and made herself believe that she and hers were better, stronger\r\n",
      "than others, and now----\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary was magnificent in her abandon and despair. Her words flowed freely,\r\n",

      "that I'm glad to tell--even you about it? I don't expect sympathy, pity,\r\n",

      "and--and other things into a state bordering on delirium. Afterward, when\r\n",
      "they had me and I was forced to live normally, simply, I began to think\r\n",
      "clearly and suffer. God! how I suffered! I faced death with the horror\r\n",
      "that only an intelligent person can know. I saw no escape. The trial, the\r\n",
      "verdict, brought me closer and closer to the hideous reality. At first\r\n",
      "I thought it could _not_ happen to me--to me! But it could! I sat day\r\n",
      "in and day out, looking at the electric chair! That was all I could see:\r\n",
      "it stood like a symbol of all the torture. I wondered how I would\r\n",
      "approach it. Would I falter, or go as most poor devils do--steadily? I\r\n",

      "die; at least something in me died. I lost breath, consciousness, and\r\n",
      "when I came to I was a poor, broken thing not worth turning the hounds\r\n",
      "on. I'm done for as far as the past's concerned. I'm a different man--not\r\n",
      "a reformed one! God knows I never played that role. I'm another man. I\r\n",
      "took what I could to keep me from insanity. I had to do something to\r\n",
      "occupy my time. That's why I've taught these poor little devils; it\r\n",

      "Ledyard was holding the white, drawn face by his merciless eyes. So he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No. I suppose in the final analysis all that justice demands is that I\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Farwell sat unmoved under this attack.\r\n",

      "\"I'm not squealing now,\" he said quietly; \"I am merely defending myself\r\n",
      "as I can. That's the prerogative of any human being, isn't it? Why, see\r\n",
      "here, Ledyard, there's one thing men like you never comprehend. On the\r\n",
      "different stratas of life exactly the same passions, impulses, and\r\n",
      "emotions exist; it's the way they're dealt with, how they affect people,\r\n",
      "that makes the difference. Up where you live and breathe they love and\r\n",

      "only thing I warn you not to laugh at! I loved her because she was\r\n",
      "beautiful, fascinating, and as--as bad as I. I knew the poor creature had\r\n",
      "never had half a show. She was born in evil and exploited from the cradle\r\n",
      "up. Martin knew it, too, and took advantage. She was fair game for him\r\n",
      "and his money. When he came down to hell to play, he played with her and\r\n",
      "defied me. But on my plane it was man against man, you see, and when he\r\n",
      "flung his plaything aside, she came to me; that's all! She told me how he\r\n",
      "had brought her where she was--yes, damn him! when she was innocent! She\r\n",
      "paid her toll then, _not_ for his money--though who would believe\r\n",
      "that?--but for the chance to be decent and clean. He told her, when\r\n",
      "she was only sixteen, that the one way she could prove her vows to him\r\n",
      "was to give herself to him. If she trusted him so far, he could trust\r\n",
      "her. She trusted, poor child! Two years later he married up on his higher\r\n",
      "plane--your plane--and laughingly offered a second best place to her. It\r\n",

      "\"Well, I took her. I was all you say, but I meant to do the right\r\n",

      "man he had, perforce, become.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether former characteristics were dead or not, who could tell?\r\n",
      "But certainly with temptation removed, with the routine of a bleak,\r\n",
      "uninteresting existence his only choice, Farwell was a harmless creature.\r\n",
      "Gradually he had found solace in the commonplaces that surrounded\r\n",
      "him. Like a person relieved of mortal agony he was grateful for\r\n",
      "semi-invalidism. Previous to Ledyard's recognition of him he had sunk to\r\n",
      "a monotonous indifference, waiting, he realized now, for the time when he\r\n",
      "might safely shake off his disguise and slip away to what was once his\r\n",
      "own. Now, with his exit from Kenmore barred, he found that he no longer\r\n",
      "could return to his stupor; he was alert, keen, and restless. In the\r\n",
      "past he had often forced himself to exercise in order that he might be\r\n",
      "ready to journey on when the time of release came. His walks to the\r\n",
      "distant town, his long hours on the water, had all been preparations\r\n",
      "for the final leave-taking from his living tomb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now that he had no need of lashing himself into action, he found\r\n",
      "himself always on the move. He worked early and late at trifling tasks\r\n",
      "that occupied his hands while sharpening his wits. With shades drawn at\r\n",
      "night, he drew, with pencil and paper, plans of escape. He must choose\r\n",
      "a calm spell after a storm; he would take his launch, with a rowboat\r\n",
      "behind, to the Fox Portage. He'd set his launch free and shoulder his\r\n",
      "boat. Once he reached the Little Bay, he'd take his chances for an\r\n",
      "outgoing steamer. He'd have plenty of money and a glib story of a bad\r\n",
      "connection. It would go. He must defeat Ledyard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he would tear the sheets of paper in bits, toss them on the coals,\r\n",
      "and laugh bitterly as he realized that he was imprisoned forever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Foolish as all this was, it had its effect upon the man. He played with\r\n",
      "the thought as a child might play with a forbidden toy. Then he decided\r\n",
      "to test the matter. He would have to buy clothes and provisions for the\r\n",
      "winter--he always made a pilgrimage about this time. There would be a\r\n",
      "letter from Boswell, too. There always was one in September. So on a\r\n",
      "certain morning Farwell turned the key in his lock and quite naturally\r\n",
      "set forth with a sense of exaltation and freedom he had imagined he would\r\n",
      "never feel again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Followed by his dogs, he went to his boat, which happened just then to be\r\n",
      "tied at the ricketty dock of the White Fish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's off for a tramp you are, maybe?\" asked Mrs. McAdam from her\r\n",
      "doorway. \"God keep you, Mr. Farwell, and bring you back safe and sound.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Farwell paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think I'll leave the dogs behind,\" he said. \"I may wish to hurry back,\r\n",
      "and a brace of dogs, keen on scents and full of spirits, is a handicap on\r\n",
      "a journey.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sure I'll feed and care for the two, and welcome, and if their staying\r\n",
      "behind brings you quicker home, 'tis a good piece of work I'm doing for\r\n",
      "Kenmore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this Mary McAdam came down to the boat and looked keenly at Farwell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you well?\" she asked with a gentleness new and touching. \"'Tis pale\r\n",
      "you look, and thin, I'm thinking. I'm getting to depend upon you, and the\r\n",
      "thought of anything happening to you grieves the heart of me. In all\r\n",
      "Kenmore there's no one as I lean on like you. There be nights when I look\r\n",
      "out toward your house and see your light a-shining when all else is dark,\r\n",
      "and say to myself, 'The master and me' over and over, and I'm less\r\n",
      "lonely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Farwell could not speak. Once an inward desire to laugh,\r\n",
      "to scoff, would have driven him to supernatural gravity; now he merely\r\n",
      "smiled with grave pleasure, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A tramp will do me good, Mrs. McAdam. Thank you. I'll take your words\r\n",
      "with me for comfort and cheer.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first night Farwell slept beside his fire, not ten miles from\r\n",
      "Kenmore. He had revelled in his freedom all day, had played like a boy,\r\n",
      "often retracing his steps, carefully using the same footprints, and\r\n",
      "laughing as he imagined the confusion of any one trying to follow him;\r\n",
      "the vague somebody being always Ledyard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a frugal meal, Farwell smoked his pipe, even attempted a snatch of\r\n",
      "rollicking song, then, rolling himself in a blanket, fell into natural\r\n",
      "and happy slumber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At four he awoke with the creeping sensation of unexplainable fear. He\r\n",
      "first thought some animal was prowling near, and, raising himself on his\r\n",
      "elbow, looked keenly about. The appearance of the fire puzzled him. It\r\n",
      "looked as if fresh wood had been laid upon it, but, as no one was in\r\n",
      "sight he concluded that his own wood had been damp, and, therefore, had\r\n",
      "burned slower.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not sleep again, however, and his excited thoughts trailed back to\r\n",
      "his past and the one woman who had magically caught and held all the best\r\n",
      "that was in him. To what point of vantage had she, poor, disabled little\r\n",
      "soul, drifted? The world was a hard enough place for a woman, God knew,\r\n",
      "and for her, with her sudden-born determination to rise above the squalor\r\n",
      "of her early youth, it would be a serious problem. Boswell told him so\r\n",
      "little. He could count on his fingers the few sharp facts his friend had\r\n",
      "given him with the promise that if conditions changed he should know, but\r\n",
      "if all remained well, he might be secure in his faith and hope for the\r\n",
      "future. The future! Was there any future for him except Kenmore? And if\r\n",
      "she heard now that he was alive, had only _seemed_ dead for her safety\r\n",
      "and his own, would she come to him and share the dun-coloured life of the\r\n",
      "In-Place?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was alive; she was faithful. Boswell was making her comfortable with\r\n",
      "Farwell's money. She was accepting less and less because she was winning\r\n",
      "her way to independence in an honourable line. Since no man had entered\r\n",
      "her life after Farwell's death was reported, Farwell could readily see\r\n",
      "why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Over and over, that first night in the woods, Farwell rehearsed these\r\n",
      "facts for comfort's sake. Suppose he made an escape. Suppose he lost\r\n",
      "himself in the city's labyrinth--what then?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then, just at daybreak, a vivid and sharp memory of the woman's face\r\n",
      "came to him as he had last seen it pressed against the bars of his cell.\r\n",
      "Behind the squares of metal it shone like an angel's. Fair, pitiful,\r\n",
      "wonder-filled eyes, and quivering mouth. All day the picture haunted him\r\n",
      "and seemed to draw him toward it. He walked twenty miles that day and\r\n",
      "came at sunset to a dense jungle where he made his camp and stretched\r\n",
      "himself exhaustedly before the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sleep did not come easily to him; he was too excited and nerve worn. The\r\n",
      "white face checked by iron bars would not fade, and in the red glow of\r\n",
      "the flames it began to look wan and haggard, as if the day had tired it\r\n",
      "and it could find no rest or comfort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The feeling of suffocation Ledyard had managed to create, returned to\r\n",
      "him. He grew nervous, ill at ease, and fearful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he fell to moralizing. He was not often given to that, or\r\n",
      "introspection. Longing and alternate hope and despair had been his\r\n",
      "comrades and bedfellows, but he rarely indulged in calm consideration.\r\n",
      "Smoking his pipe, stretched wearily on the moss, he wondered if men knew\r\n",
      "how much they punished while fulfilling their ideals of justice?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If only the sense of vindictiveness could be left out,\" he thought; \"the\r\n",
      "Lord knows they have it all in their power once the key is turned on us.\r\n",
      "I deserved all they meant to inflict, but no human being deserves all\r\n",
      "that was given unconsciously.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Farwell relived his life, while the wood crumbled to ashes and the\r\n",
      "moon came up over the hills. A misguided, misspent boyhood; too much\r\n",
      "money; too little common sense; then the fling in the open with every\r\n",
      "emotion and desire uncurbed. Well, he had to learn his lesson and God\r\n",
      "knew he had; but why, in the working of things, shouldn't one be given\r\n",
      "a chance to prove the well-learned task; an opportunity, while among the\r\n",
      "living, to settle the question?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, such fancies were idle, and Farwell shook the ashes from his\r\n",
      "pipe and gave a humorous shrug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be a fine piece of work to slip from the clutches of the past\r\n",
      "and make good! This idea caused him to tremble. Surely no one would look\r\n",
      "for him in the camp of the upright. Walking the paths of the clean and\r\n",
      "sane he would be more surely secure from detection than anywhere else on\r\n",
      "earth. That was what his past had done for him. The truth of this sank\r\n",
      "into the lonely man's soul with sickening finality. And as he realized\r\n",
      "it, and compared it with the fact of his youth, he groaned. What an\r\n",
      "infernal fool he had been! What fools all such fellows were who, like\r\n",
      "him, wasted everything in their determination to make the unreal, real.\r\n",
      "He did not now desire to be a drivelling repentant; he wanted, God knew\r\n",
      "he really wanted, a chance to be decent and live; but in order to live he\r\n",
      "must go on acting a part and cringing and hiding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These thoughts led nowhere and unfitted him for his journey, so he made\r\n",
      "the fire safe, lay down beside it, and slept as many a better man would\r\n",
      "have given much to sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At four he awoke as on the previous night. So quietly, however, did he\r\n",
      "open his eyes that he took by surprise a man crouching by the fire as if\r\n",
      "stealing a bit of warmth. Farwell turned over, and the two eyed each\r\n",
      "other with wide, penetrating gaze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tough Pine, the guide, finding himself discovered, grinned sheepishly; he\r\n",
      "was loathing himself for being taken off guard, and muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me share fire? me helped keep it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell raised himself on his elbow, all the light and courage gone from\r\n",
      "his face. It was the old story, the dream of freedom and--the prison\r\n",
      "bars!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are you going?\" he asked, though he knew full well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where--you go? There, Pine go! Pine--good friend and good guide.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They questioned each other no more. Farwell finished his errand in dull\r\n",
      "fashion, bought his goods, found a letter, long waiting him, read all the\r\n",
      "papers he could lay hands on, and then set his face toward Kenmore. And\r\n",
      "that winter he devoted himself as he never had before to the simple\r\n",
      "people who were the means of keeping him sane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon this newly restricted and devastated horizon Priscilla Glenn loomed\r\n",
      "large and vital. With Nathaniel's loosened rein and Theodora's restored\r\n",
      "faith, the girl developed wonderfully. Farwell made no more objection to\r\n",
      "her dancing or her flights of fancy. He fiddled for her and fed the flame\r\n",
      "of her imagination. She was the sunniest creature he had ever known;\r\n",
      "the bleak life of Lonely Farm had spurred her to greater lengths of\r\n",
      "self-defence; nothing could daunt her. She had an absorbing curiosity\r\n",
      "about life, out and beyond the Kenmore confines; and more to keep his own\r\n",
      "memory clear than to satisfy Priscilla, Farwell set himself to the task\r\n",
      "of educating the girl in ways that would have appalled Nathaniel and\r\n",
      "reduced Theodora again to tears and apprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bare room of the master's house was the stage upon which were set, in\r\n",
      "turn, the scenes of distant city life. Vicariously Priscilla learned the\r\n",
      "manners of a \"real lady\" under the most trying circumstances. Farwell\r\n",
      "told her of plays, operas, and, over his deal table, they chatted in\r\n",
      "brilliant restaurants. They walked gay streets and stood bewildered\r\n",
      "before flashing shop windows. It was all dangerous, but fascinating, and\r\n",
      "in the playing of the game Farwell grew old and drawn, while Priscilla\r\n",
      "gradually came into her Heart's Desire of delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My Road!\" she proudly thought. \"My Road!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old poem was recalled and was often repeated like a litany, while\r\n",
      "life became more and more vital and thrilling with dull Kenmore as a\r\n",
      "background and setting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just about this time Jerry-Jo took to wearing his Sunday suit on week\r\n",
      "days, thus proclaiming his aspirations and awaking the ribald jests of\r\n",
      "his particular set.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary Terhune, now partner of Mrs. McAdam, took note of Jerry-Jo's\r\n",
      "appearance, and, on a certain afternoon in midwinter, when she, Long\r\n",
      "Jean, and Mary McAdam sat by the range in the White Fish kitchen, fanned\r\n",
      "a lively bit of gossip into flame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Trade's a bit poor these days, eh, Jean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jean grunted over her cup of green tea.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What with poverty and the terrors of losing them, there's enough born to\r\n",
      "my thinking. Time was when the young 'uns happened; they're thought more\r\n",
      "on, these days. Women _should_ have a say. If there's one thing a man\r\n",
      "should keep his tongue off it's this matter of families!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this outrageous sentiment the listeners replied merely by two audible\r\n",
      "gulps of tea, and then Mary Terhune found grace to remark:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You certainly do talk most wonderful things, Mary McAdam. You be an\r\n",
      "ornament to your sex, but only such women as you can grip them audacious\r\n",
      "ideas. Let them be sowed broadcast and----\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "mysterious shake of her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Any change for the better would be welcome,\" Mrs. McAdam retorted. \"Have\r\n",
      "another cup, Jean? Strong or weak?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Strong. I says often, says I, that unless tea curls your tongue you\r\n",
      "might just as well take water. When I'm on duty I keep a pot on the back\r\n",
      "of the stove week in and week out; it do brace me powerful.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. McAdam poured the tea into the outstretched cup and proceeded to\r\n",
      "discuss Jerry-Jo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why doesn't the scamp go to the States and find himself instead of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"He may have it in his mind,\" soothed Mary Terhune, \"but the lad's deep\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You've saved your face, Mrs. Terhune. Go on!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jean had begun to resent, but the explanation mollified her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"More tea,\" she said quietly, \"and you might stir the dregs a mite, Mrs.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Long Jean bridled again and interjected:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And for why not? Young folks is young folks, and there ain't too many\r\n",
      "boys for the gels. What with the States and the toll to death, the gels\r\n",
      "can't be too particular, not casting my flings at Jerry-Jo, either. He's\r\n",
      "a handsome lad and will get a footing some day. Glenn's girl ain't none\r\n",
      "too good for him; he'd bring her to her senses. All that dancing and\r\n",
      "fiddle-scraping at Master Farwell's is not to my liking. The goings-on\r\n",
      "are evil-looking to my mind. The girl always was a parcel of\r\n",
      "whim-whams--made up of odds and ends, as it was, of her fore-runners.\r\n",
      "What _all_ the children of the Glenns might have been--Priscilla is!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So Jerry-Jo's fixed his bold eyes on the girl?\" asked Mary McAdam. \"It\r\n",
      "bodes no good for her. She's a sunny creature and mighty taking in her\r\n",
      "ways. I wish her no ill, and I hate to think of Jerry-Jo shadowing her\r\n",
      "life till she forgets to dance and sing. For my part, I wish the master\r\n",
      "were twenty-five years younger and could play for the lass to dance to\r\n",
      "the end of their days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "in my toes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And while this talk and more like it was permeating Kenmore, Jerry-Jo,\r\n",
      "adorned and uncomfortable, did his own thinking and planned his own plans\r\n",
      "after the manner of his mixed inheritance. He could not settle to any\r\n",
      "task or give heed to any temptation from the States until he had made\r\n",
      "Priscilla secure. The girl's age in no wise daunted McAlpin. His eighteen\r\n",
      "years were all that were to be considered; he knew what he wanted, what\r\n",
      "he meant to have. He could wait, he could bide the fulfillment of his\r\n",
      "hopes, but one big, compelling subject at a time was all he could master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He secretly and furiously objected to the dancing and visits in Farwell's\r\n",
      "cottage. He was ashamed to voice this feeling, for Farwell was his friend\r\n",
      "and had taught him all he knew, but Farwell's age did not in the least\r\n",
      "blind Jerry-Jo to the fact that he was a man, and he did not enjoy seeing\r\n",
      "Priscilla so free and easy with any other of the male sex, be he ancient\r\n",
      "enough to topple into the grave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She'll dance for me--for me!\" the young fellow ground his teeth. \"I'll\r\n",
      "make her forget to prance and grin unless she does it for me. The\r\n",
      "master's just training her away from me and putting notions in her head.\r\n",
      "I'll take her to the States--maybe her dancing will help us both there.\r\n",

      "forgotten Kenmore, was nearing nineteen, with Jerry-Jo in hot pursuit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Anton Farwell had, little by little, accepted the fate of those who,\r\n",
      "deprived of many blessings, learn to depend on a few. As the remaining\r\n",
      "senses are sharpened by the loss of one, so in this man's life the\r\n",
      "cramping process, begun by his own wrongdoing, and prolonged and\r\n",
      "completed by other conditions, had the effect of focussing all his power\r\n",
      "on the atoms that went to the making up of the daily record of his days.\r\n",
      "Had he kept a diary it would have been interesting from its very lack of\r\n",
      "large interest. And yet, with all this narrowing down, a certain fineness\r\n",
      "and purpose evolved that were both touching and inspiring. He never\r\n",
      "complained, not even to himself. After recognizing the power which\r\n",
      "Ledyard held in his life, he relinquished the one hope that had held him\r\n",
      "to the past. Then, for a year or two, the light of the doctor's contempt,\r\n",
      "which had been turned on him, took the zest from the small efforts he had\r\n",
      "made for better living and caused him to distrust himself. He saw himself\r\n",
      "what he knew Ledyard thought him--a mean, cowardly creature, and yet, in\r\n",
      "his better moments, he knew this was not so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Men have made friends of mice and insects in prison,\" he argued; \"they\r\n",
      "have kept their reason by so doing; why, in heaven's name, shouldn't I\r\n",
      "play with these people here and make life possible?\"\r\n",

      "dwelt apart and clung to the few--Priscilla Glenn, Mary McAdam, and old\r\n",
      "Jerry McAlpin--who regarded him in the light of a priest to whom they\r\n",
      "might confess freely.\r\n",

      "threatened such a friendship--Nathaniel, Jerry-Jo, and the girl\r\n",
      "herself--for Priscilla, during the first years of Nathaniel's relaxed\r\n",
      "severity, was like a bee sipping every flower, and Farwell was not at\r\n",
      "all confident that anything he had to give would hold even her passing\r\n",
      "interest for long. Then, too, like a many-wounded creature, he dreaded\r\n",
      "a new danger, even though for a moment it gave promise of comfort. But\r\n",
      "finally Priscilla got her bearings and more and more brought all her\r\n",
      "powers to bear upon one ambition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The childish madness that prompted her to run away from anything that\r\n",
      "hurt or angered her, gradually disappeared, and in its place came a staid\r\n",
      "determination to seek her fortunes, soon, in some place distant from\r\n",
      "Kenmore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tourists opened a new vista to her, but many of them, with stupid\r\n",
      "ignorance, mistook her position and traditions. She was offered\r\n",
      "occupations as cook, maid, or laundress. She had sense of humour enough\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"But there is one up at the Lodge,\" Priscilla went on more gravely, \"who\r\n",

      "I have watched and tended together. She says I have the touch and nature\r\n",
      "of the true nurse and she has told me how in the States, and England,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This interested Anton Farwell a good deal and he and Priscilla discussed\r\n",
      "it often after the woman who had just broached it had departed. It seemed\r\n",
      "such a normal, natural opening for Priscilla if the time really came for\r\n",
      "her to go away. The doubt that she would eventually go was slight in\r\n",
      "Farwell's heart. He, keener than others, saw the closing-in of\r\n",
      "conditions. He was not blind to Jerry-Jo's primitive attempts to attract\r\n",
      "the girl's attention, but he was not deceived. When the moment came that\r\n",
      "Priscilla recognized the half-breed's real thought, Farwell knew her\r\n",
      "quick impulse would, as of old, be to fly away. She was like a wild bird,\r\n",
      "he often pondered; she would give to great lengths, flutter close, and\r\n",
      "love tenderly, but no restraining or harsh touch could do aught but set\r\n",
      "her to flight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At twenty-three Jerry-Jo surlily and passionately came to the conclusion\r\n",
      "that he must in some way capture his prize. Other youths were wearing\r\n",
      "gaudy ties and imperilling their Sunday bests; he was letting precious\r\n",
      "time slip. Then, too, by Farwell's advice, old Jerry was growing rigid\r\n",
      "along financial lines, and at last the _States_ took definite shape in\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo's mind, but he meant to have Priscilla before he heeded the\r\n",
      "lure. With all his brazen conceit and daring he intuitively knew that\r\n",
      "the girl had never thought of him as he thought of her, and he dared not\r\n",
      "awaken her by legitimate means. Quite in keeping with his unrestrained\r\n",
      "nature, he plotted, indirectly, to secure what otherwise might escape\r\n",
      "him. Fully realizing Nathaniel's attitude toward his daughter, counting\r\n",
      "his distorted conceptions and foolish pride, Jerry-Jo began to construct\r\n",
      "an obstacle that would shut Priscilla from her father's protection and\r\n",
      "cause her to accept what others had to offer--others, being always and\r\n",
      "ever, himself!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once Lonely Farm was closed to the girl, other houses in the serenely\r\n",
      "moral In-Place would inevitably slam their doors. The cunning of the\r\n",
      "half-breed was diabolic in its sureness. Anton Farwell could not assume\r\n",
      "responsibility for Priscilla if all Kenmore turned its back on her, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "door leading to the Green. For a wonder, what he was reading had absorbed\r\n",
      "him, and he was far and away from the In-Place. He had taken to fine, old\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I declare!\" he exclaimed. \"I did not know you, Priscilla Glenn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His tone had a new ring in it, a vibration of defence--the astonished\r\n",
      "male on guard against the attack of a subtle force whose power he could\r\n",
      "not estimate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And no wonder. I did not know myself when I first saw myself. Do you\r\n",
      "know, Mr. Farwell, I never thought about my--my face, much, but it is\r\n",
      "really a--very nice face, isn't it? As faces go, I mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" Farwell returned, looking at her critically and speaking slowly.\r\n",
      "\"Yes, you are very--beautiful. I had not thought of it before, either.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Drop me down, now, in the States, Mr. Farwell, and I fancy that with my\r\n",
      "looks and my dancing I might--well, go! What do you think?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was preening herself before a small mirror and did not notice the\r\n",
      "elderly man, who, under her fascination, was being transformed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're a regular Frankenstein,\" he muttered, while the consciousness\r\n",
      "of the blue eyes in the dusky skin, the long slenderness of her body,\r\n",
      "and the hue of her strange hair grew upon him. \"Do you know what a\r\n",
      "Frankenstein is?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\" And now Priscilla, weary of her play and self-contemplation, turned\r\n",
      "about and took a chair opposite Farwell. \"Tell me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he told her, but she shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've only helped me to find myself; you did not make me,\" she said\r\n",
      "with a little sigh. \"Oh, Mr. Farwell, I do--much thinking up at Lonely\r\n",
      "Farm. The winters are long, and the nights, too. You know there is a\r\n",
      "queer little plant beside the spring at the foot of our garden; it has\r\n",
      "roots long enough and thick enough for a thing twice its size. It grew\r\n",
      "strong and sure underground before it ventured up. It blossomed last\r\n",
      "summer; an odd flower it had. I think I am like that. You've taught me\r\n",
      "to--well, know myself. I shall not shame you, Master Farwell. You know we\r\n",
      "of the lonesome In-Place make friends with strange objects; everything in\r\n",
      "nature talks to us, if we will but listen. You have taught me to listen,\r\n",
      "too. Back a piece in the woods are a strong young hemlock and a little\r\n",
      "white birch. For years I have watched and tended them. When I was a small\r\n",
      "girl I likened the hemlock to you, sir, and there was I, leaning and\r\n",
      "huddling close to you, like the ghostly stripling of the woods. Well, I\r\n",
      "noticed to-day, Mr. Farwell, the birch stands quite securely; it doesn't\r\n",
      "bend for support on the hemlock, but it is standing friendly all the\r\n",
      "same. I think\"--and here Priscilla clasped her hands close and\r\n",
      "outstretched them--\"I think I am soon going away!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her eyes were tear-dimmed, her face very earnest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish--you would give up the childish folly, Priscilla.\" A fear rose\r\n",
      "in Farwell's eyes. \"What could you, such an one as you have become, do\r\n",
      "out--in the States? It is madness--sheer, brutal madness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You think it childish folly? Why, I have never lost sight of it for a\r\n",
      "day. You have not understood me if you have imagined that. I have always\r\n",
      "known I must go. Lately I have felt the nearness of the going, and it is\r\n",
      "the _how_ to break away and begin that puzzle me. I am ready.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Priscilla, you are a wild child still, playing with dangerous tools.\r\n",
      "You cannot comprehend the trouble into which you are willing, in your\r\n",
      "blindness, to plunge. Why, you are a--a woman; a beautiful one! Do you\r\n",
      "know what the world does with such, unless they are guarded and\r\n",
      "protected?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it do?\" The true eyes held Farwell commandingly, and with a\r\n",
      "sense of dismay he looked back at the only world he really knew: the\r\n",
      "world of his own ungoverned passions and selfishness. A kind of shame\r\n",
      "came over him, and he felt he was no safe guide. There were worlds and\r\n",
      "worlds! He had sold his birthright; this woman, bent upon finding hers,\r\n",
      "might inherit a fairer kingdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it do, Master Farwell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not know. It depends upon--you. It is like a great quarry--I have\r\n",
      "read somewhere something like this--we must all mould and chisel our\r\n",
      "characters; some of us crush them and chip them. It isn't always the\r\n",
      "world's fault. God help us!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with such brave courage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do not fear for me,\" she said gently; \"'twould be a poor return if I\r\n",

      "the setting of the faded hat and soiled veil, struck Farwell again by its\r\n",
      "change, which now seemed to have settled into permanency. Of course it\r\n",
      "was only the ridiculous fashion of the world he once knew, but he could\r\n",
      "not free himself of the fancy that Priscilla was more her real self in\r\n",
      "the shabby trappings than she had ever been in the absurd costumes of the\r\n",
      "In-Place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the acceptance of the fact that the girl really meant to get away\r\n",
      "and at once, a wave of dreariness swept over him. He thought of the time\r\n",
      "on ahead when his last vital interest would be taken from him. Then he\r\n",
      "aroused from his stupor and brought his mind to bear upon the inevitable;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a big drop in your ambition, Priscilla,\" he said; \"you used to\r\n",

      "jolly and friendly with those you care for. It will all be so different\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The girl's eyes flashed with mischief and daring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "We've played together and quarrelled together, but you're all wrong,\r\n",
      "Master Farwell, if you think he cares about me! He knows better than\r\n",
      "that--far, far, better.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But even as she spoke the light and fun left her eyes. She looked older,\r\n",
      "more thoughtful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Isn't it queer?\" she said after a pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Priscilla?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, life and people and the things that go to their making? You're quite\r\n",
      "wrong about Jerry-Jo. I'm sure you're wrong.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then suddenly she sprang up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must go,\" she said abruptly; \"go and exchange these rags for my own\r\n",
      "plain things. I only wanted to surprise you, sir; and how deadly serious\r\n",
      "we have grown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She passed out of the cottage without a word more. Farwell watched her\r\n",
      "across the Green and up to the Lodge. He was disturbed and restless. The\r\n",
      "old fever of escape overcame him. With the thought of Priscilla's flight\r\n",
      "into the open, he strained against the trap that Ledyard had caught him\r\n",
      "in. The guide who, he knew, never permitted him to escape his vigilance,\r\n",
      "became a new and alarming obstacle, and Farwell set his teeth grimly.\r\n",
      "Then he muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Curse him! curse him!\" and an emotion which he had believed was long\r\n",
      "since dead rose hotly in his consciousness. Before the dread spectre,\r\n",
      "suddenly imbued with vitality, Farwell reeled and covered his face.\r\n",
      "Murder was in his heart--the old madness of desire to wipe out, by any\r\n",
      "means, that which barred his way to what he wanted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My God!\" he moaned; \"my God! I--I thought I--was master. I thought it\r\n",
      "was dead in me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell ate no evening meal that night. Early he closed and locked his\r\n",
      "outer door, drew the dark green shades, and lighted his lamp. His hands\r\n",
      "were clammy and cold, and he could not blot out with book or violin the\r\n",
      "horror of Charles Martin's face as it looked up at him that night so long\r\n",
      "ago. Way on toward morning Farwell paced his room trying to forget, but\r\n",
      "he could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Priscilla, after leaving Farwell, dressed again in her plain\r\n",
      "serviceable gown and hat, had made her way toward the farm. Her happy,\r\n",
      "light-hearted mood was past; she felt unaccountably gloomy, and as she\r\n",
      "walked on she sought to explain herself to herself, and presently\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo came into focus and would not stir from her contemplation. Yes,\r\n",
      "it was Jerry-Jo's personality that disturbed her, and it was Farwell's\r\n",
      "words that had torn the shield she herself had erected, and set the truth\r\n",
      "free. Yes, she had played with Jerry-Jo; she had tested her coquetry and\r\n",
      "charm upon him for lack of better material. In her outbreaks of youthful\r\n",
      "spirits she had claimed him as prey because the others of his sex were\r\n",
      "less desirable. Jerry-Jo had that subtle, physical attraction that\r\n",
      "responded to her youthful allurements, but the young fellow himself,\r\n",
      "taken seriously, repelled her, and Farwell had taken Jerry-Jo seriously!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was it! She was no longer a child. She was a woman and must remember\r\n",
      "it. Undoubtedly Jerry-Jo himself had never given the matter a moment's\r\n",
      "deep thought. Well, she must take care that he never did. Jerry-Jo in\r\n",
      "earnest would be unbearable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then, just as she reached the pasture bars separating her father's\r\n",
      "farm from the red rock highway, Jerry-Jo McAlpin strode in sight from the\r\n",
      "wood path into which the highway ran. She waited for him and gave him a\r\n",
      "nervous smile as he came near. His first words startled her out of her\r\n",
      "dull mood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've been up to the Hill Place. Him and her's there for a few days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Him and her!\" Priscilla repeated, her face flushing. \"Oh, him and her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sure!\" McAlpin was holding her with a hard, fixed gaze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the mesh that was closing about Priscilla, strangely enough names\r\n",
      "were always largely eliminated. They might have altered her course later\r\n",
      "on, might have held her to the past, but Kenmore dealt briefly with\r\n",
      "personalities and visualized whatever it could. The name Travers had\r\n",
      "rarely, if ever, been spoken in Priscilla's presence. \"The Hill Place\r\n",
      "folks\" was the title found sufficient for general use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I was remembering,\" Jerry-Jo went on, \"how once you said you wanted\r\n",
      "to thank him for--for the books. We might take the canoe, come to-morrow,\r\n",
      "and the day is fine, and pay a visit.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still Priscilla did not notice the gleam in McAlpin's keen eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! if I only dared, Jerry-Jo! What an adventure it would be, to be\r\n",
      "sure. And how good of you to think of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What hinders?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Father would never forgive me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And are you always to be at the beck and whistle of your father even in\r\n",
      "your pleasures?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was in just the attitude of mind to receive this suggestion\r\n",
      "with appreciation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's no reason why I shouldn't go if I want to,\" she said with an\r\n",
      "uplift of her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And--don't you want to?\" Jerry-Jo's eyes were taking in the loveliness\r\n",
      "of the raised face as the setting sun fell upon it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I do want to! I'll go, Jerry-Jo.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then McAlpin came close to her and said in a low voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Priscilla, give us a kiss for pay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So taken out of herself was the girl, so overpowered by the excitement\r\n",
      "of adventure, that before she realized her part in the small drama of\r\n",
      "passionate youth, she gave a mocking laugh and twisted her lips saucily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo had her in his arms on the instant, and the hot kiss he pressed\r\n",
      "on her mouth roused her to fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you ever touch me again,\" she whispered, struggling into freedom,\r\n",
      "\"I'll hate you to the last day of my life!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So had she spoken to her father years ago; so would she always speak when\r\n",
      "her reservations were threatened. \"I declare I am afraid to go with you\r\n",
      "to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "McAlpin fell back in shamed contrition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You need not be afraid,\" he muttered. \"I reckon I was bidding\r\n",
      "you--good-bye. Him and me is different. Once you see him and he sees you,\r\n",
      "it's good-bye to Jerry-Jo McAlpin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something in the words and tone of humility brought Priscilla, with a\r\n",
      "bound, back to a kindlier mood. After all, it was a tribute that McAlpin\r\n",
      "was paying her. She must hold him in check, that was all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They parted with no great change. There had been a flurry, but it had\r\n",
      "served to clear the atmosphere--for her at least.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Nathaniel, that evening in the kitchen, managed to arouse in the girl\r\n",
      "the one state of mind needed to drive her on her course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What was the meaning of that scuffling by the bars a time back?\" he\r\n",
      "asked, eyeing Priscilla with the old look of suspicious antagonism. Every\r\n",
      "nerve in the girl's body twitched with resentment and her spirit flared\r\n",
      "forth. She shielded herself behind the one flimsy subterfuge that Glenn\r\n",
      "could never understand or tolerate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A kiss you mean. What's a kiss? You call that a scuffle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Theodora, who was washing the tea dishes while Priscilla wiped them, took\r\n",
      "her usual course and began to cry dispiritedly and forlornly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's between you and--McAlpin?\" Nathaniel asked, scowling darkly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Between us? What need for anything between us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla ceased smiling and looked defiant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Maybe you better marry that half-breed and have done with it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's more like--would _he_ marry me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was unfortunate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why not?\" Nathaniel shook the ashes from his pipe angrily. \"A little\r\n",
      "more such performance as I saw to-day and no decent man will marry you!\r\n",
      "As for Jerry-Jo, he'll marry you if I say so! You foul my nest, miss, and\r\n",
      "out you go!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Husband! husband!\" And with this Theodora dropped a cup, one of Glenn's\r\n",
      "mother's cups, and somehow this added fire to his fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when the time comes, wife, you make your choice: Go with her, who\r\n",
      "you have trained into what she is, or stay with me who has been defied in\r\n",
      "his own home, by them nearest and closest to him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla breathed fast and hard. The tangible wall of misunderstanding\r\n",
      "between her and her father stifled her to-night as it never had before.\r\n",
      "Again she realized the finality of something--the breaking of the old\r\n",

      "The next day was gloriously clear and threateningly warm. Such days do\r\n",
      "not come to Kenmore in September except to lure the unheeding to acts of\r\n",
      "folly. And at two o'clock in the afternoon Priscilla, from the kitchen\r\n",
      "door, saw Jerry-Jo paddling his canoe in still, Indian fashion around\r\n",
      "Lone Tree Island. Theodora was off erranding, and Nathaniel, as far as\r\n",
      "human knowledge went, was in some distant field; he had started off\r\n",
      "directly after dinner. Priscilla was ready for her adventure. With the\r\n",
      "natural desire of youth, she had decked herself out in her modest\r\n",
      "finery--a stiffly starched white gown of a cheap but pretty design, a\r\n",
      "fluff of soft lace at throat and wrist, and, over it, the old red cape\r\n",
      "that years before had added to her appearance as she danced on the rocks.\r\n",
      "Perhaps remembering that, she had utilized the garment and was thankful\r\n",
      "that cloth lasted so long in Kenmore!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coquetry of girlhood rose happily in Priscilla's heart. Jerry-Jo had\r\n",
      "become again simply a link in her chain of events; he had lost the\r\n",
      "importance the flash of the evening before had given him; he was not\r\n",
      "forgiven, but for the time he was, as a human being, forgotten. He was\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo who was to paddle her to her Heart's Desire! That was it, and\r\n",
      "the old words, set to music of her own, were the signals used to attract\r\n",
      "McAlpin's attention. But the merry call brought Glenn from out the barn\r\n",

      "step in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where you two going?\" he shouted in the tone that always roused the\r\n",
      "worst in Priscilla's nature. Jerry-Jo paused, paddle in air, but his\r\n",
      "companion whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on!\" To Nathaniel she flung back: \"We're going to have a bit of fun,\r\n",

      "\"Come back!\" he ordered, but the little canoe had shot out into the\r\n",
      "Channel. \"Hi, there McAlpin, do you hear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on!\" again whispered Priscilla, and Jerry-Jo heard only her soft\r\n",
      "command, for his senses were filled with the loveliness of her charming,\r\n",
      "defiant face set under the broad brim of a hat around which was twined\r\n",
      "a wreath of natural flowers as blue as the girl's laughing eyes.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You'll catch it,\" Jerry-Jo comforted when pursuit was impossible, and he\r\n",

      "place, and you need not drag me in, for I'd have turned back had you said\r\n",
      "the word.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it matter, Jerry-Jo? All my life, ever since I can remember,\r\n",
      "I have been growing surely to what is now near at hand. I cannot abide my\r\n",
      "father; nor can he find comfort in me. Why should I darken the lives of\r\n",
      "my parents and have no life of my own? The lure of the States has always\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Only this: It would be no strange thing did a boy start for the States.\r\n",
      "A little money, a ticket on a steamer, and--pouf! Off the boys and men\r\n",
      "go to make their lives. Well, then, some day you will--find me gone,\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo. Gone to make my life. Will you miss me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This question caused McAlpin to stop paddling.\r\n",

      "\"You won't be--let!\" he murmured; \"you--a girl!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I, a girl!\" Priscilla laughed scornfully. \"You will see. This day, after\r\n",
      "I have thanked him up yonder, I am going to ask his mother to help me get\r\n",
      "away. Surely a lady such as she could help me. I will not ask much of\r\n",
      "her, only the guiding hand to a safe place where I can--live! Oh! can you\r\n",
      "understand how all my life I have been smothered and stifled? I often\r\n",
      "wonder what sort I will be--out there! I'm willing to suffer while I\r\n",
      "learn, but Jerry-Jo\"--and here the excited voice paused--\"I have a\r\n",
      "strange feeling of--myself! I sometimes feel as if there were two of me,\r\n",
      "the one holding, demanding, and protecting the other. I will not have men\r\n",
      "always making my life and shielding me; the woman of me will have its\r\n",
      "way. Men and boys never know this feeling.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Jerry-Jo could, of course, understand nothing of this, but the thing\r\n",
      "he had set out to do, more in rude, brutish fun than anything else,\r\n",
      "assumed graver purpose. A new and ugly look grew in his bold eyes, a\r\n",
      "sinister smile on his red mouth, which showed the points of his white,\r\n",
      "fang-like teeth. But Priscilla, too absorbed with her own thoughts, did\r\n",
      "not notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was four o'clock when the canoe touched the landing spot of Far Hill\r\n",
      "Place, and Priscilla sprang out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll bide here; don't be long,\" said McAlpin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Priscilla paused and glanced up at the sky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's darkening,\" she faltered, a shyness overcoming her. \"I\r\n",
      "smell--thunder. Don't you think you better come up with me Jerry-Jo?\r\n",
      "Suppose they are not at home?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They'll be back soon in that case, and as for a shower, that would\r\n",
      "hasten them and you would be under shelter. I can turn the canoe over me\r\n",
      "and be dry as a mouse in a hayrick. I'll not go with you, not I. Do your\r\n",
      "own part, with them looking on as will enjoy it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I believe you are--jealous, Jerry-Jo.\" This was said idly and more to\r\n",
      "fill in an awkward pause than for anything else.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And much good that would do me, after what you've just said. If you're\r\n",
      "bound for the devil, Priscilla, 'tis little power I have to stay you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not--for the devil!\" Priscilla flung back, and started sturdily up\r\n",
      "the hill path toward the house hidden among the trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Out of McAlpin's sight, the girl went more slowly, while she sought to\r\n",
      "arrange her mode of attack. If her host were what he once was, he would\r\n",
      "make everything easy after she recalled herself to him. As for the\r\n",
      "mother, Priscilla had only a dim memory of her, but something told her\r\n",
      "that the call would be a happy and memorable one after the first moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A bit of tune cheered the girl; a repeating of the Road Song helped even\r\n",
      "more, for it resurrected most vividly the young fellow who had introduced\r\n",
      "music and happiness into her life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll be doshed!\" she cried. The word had not passed her lips for years;\r\n",
      "it brought a laugh and a complete restoration of poise. So she reached\r\n",
      "the house. Smoke was issuing from the chimney. A fire had been made even\r\n",
      "on this hot day, but like enough it was to dry the place after the years\r\n",
      "of closed doors and windows. Evidently it was a many-houred fire, for the\r\n",
      "plume of smoke was faint and steady. The broad door was set wide but the\r\n",
      "windows were still boarded up at the front of the house, though the side\r\n",
      "ones had escaped that protection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla knocked and waited. No reply or sound came in response, and\r\n",
      "presently a low muttering of distant thunder broke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That will bring them in short order,\" she said, \"and surely they will\r\n",
      "not object if I make myself comfortable until they come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went inside. The room had the appearance of one from which the owner\r\n",
      "had long been absent, that unaccountable, vacant look, although a\r\n",
      "work-bag hung on the back of a chair by the roaring fire, and a blot of\r\n",
      "oil lay on the table near the lamp which had evidently been recently\r\n",
      "filled. Back of these tokens lay a wide sense of desolation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Priscilla hesitated before sitting down; her courage failed,\r\n",
      "but a second thought reconciled conditions with a brief stay after long\r\n",
      "absence, and she decided to wait.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And while she waited, suddenly and alarmingly, the storm burst! The\r\n",
      "darkness of the room and the wooded space outside had deceived her: there\r\n",
      "was no escape now!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was concerned for the people she had come to see. Jerry-Jo, she knew,\r\n",
      "would crawl under his boat and be as dry as a tortoise in its shell. But\r\n",
      "those others!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With this thought she set about, mechanically, making the room\r\n",
      "comfortable. She piled on fresh wood and noticed that it was so wet that\r\n",
      "it sputtered dangerously. Presently the wind changed sharply, and a blast\r\n",
      "of almost icy coldness carried the driving rain halfway across the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was something of a struggle to close the heavy door, for it opened\r\n",
      "outward, and Priscilla was drenched by the time it was made secure.\r\n",
      "Breathing hard, she made her way to the fire and knelt before it. The\r\n",
      "glow drew her attention from the darkness of the space back and around\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was unfortunate and depressing, and she had no choice but to make\r\n",
      "herself as comfortable as she might, though a sense of painful uneasiness\r\n",
      "grew momentarily. At first she imagined it was fear of what she must\r\n",
      "encounter upon her return home; then she felt sure it was her dread of\r\n",
      "meeting the people for whom she had risked so much. Finally Jerry-Jo\r\n",
      "loomed in the foreground of her thought and an entirely new terror was\r\n",
      "born in her soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jerry-Jo!\" she laughed aloud as his name passed her lips. \"Jerry-Jo, to\r\n",
      "be sure. My! how thankful I'd be to see him this instant!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with the assertion she turned shudderingly toward the door. The gloom\r\n",
      "behind her only emphasized her nervousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll--I'll have to go!\" she whispered suddenly, while the wind and the\r\n",
      "slashing of sleety rain defied her. \"It will be better out of doors, bad\r\n",
      "as it is!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grim loneliness of four walls, compared with the dangers of the open,\r\n",
      "was worse. But when Priscilla, trembling and panting, reached the door\r\n",
      "and pushed, she found that the storm was pitting its strength against\r\n",
      "hers and she could not budge it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, well,\" she half sobbed; \"if I must, I must.\" And she stealthily\r\n",
      "tiptoed back to the warmth and light as if fearing to arouse something,\r\n",
      "she knew not what, in the dim place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no way of estimating time. The minutes were like hours and the\r\n",
      "hours were like minutes while Priscilla sat alone. As a matter of fact,\r\n",
      "it was after seven when steps, unmistakable steps, sounded on the porch\r\n",
      "and carried both apprehension and relief to the storm-bound prisoner\r\n",
      "inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank heaven!\" breathed she, and sprang to her feet. She was midway in\r\n",
      "the room when the door opened, and, as if flayed forward by the lashing\r\n",
      "storm, Jerry-Jo broke into the shadow and drew the heavy oak door after\r\n",
      "him. In a black panic of fear Priscilla saw him turn the key in the lock\r\n",
      "before he spoke a word to her; then he came forward, flung his wet cap\r\n",
      "toward the hearth, and laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" he asked quickly as Priscilla's white face\r\n",
      "confronted him. \"Disappointed, I suppose. Do you begrudge me a bit of\r\n",
      "warmth and shelter? God knows I'm drenched to the bone. The rain came up\r\n",
      "from the earth as well as down from the clouds. It's a devil's storm and\r\n",
      "no mistake. What you staring at, Priscilla? Had you forgotten me? Thought\r\n",
      "me dead, and now you're looking at my ghost? Didn't I wait long enough\r\n",
      "for you? Where are the--others?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This seemed to clarify and steady the situation and Priscilla gave a\r\n",
      "slight laugh:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To be sure. You did not know. They--they were away. The storm came up\r\n",
      "suddenly. I had to wait. You are wet through and through, Jerry-Jo. It's\r\n",
      "good we have such a fire. You'll be comfortable in a moment. I'm glad you\r\n",
      "came; I was getting--afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's see if there is any oil in the lamp!\" Jerry-Jo exclaimed. He was\r\n",
      "in no mood for darkness himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They must have filled it before they went,\" Priscilla answered. \"See,\r\n",
      "there is some oil on the table.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "McAlpin struck a match and soon the room was flooded with a new\r\n",
      "brightness that reached even to the far corners and seemed to set free\r\n",
      "the real loneliness that held these two together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I managed to keep this dry,\" McAlpin spoke huskily. \"I always have\r\n",
      "a bite with me when I take to the woods. Who can ever tell what may\r\n",
      "happen!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pushed a coarse sandwich toward Priscilla and began eating one\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on!\" he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm not hungry, Jerry-Jo, and I want to start back home at once.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo leered at her over his bread and meat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's your hurry? I want to get warm and dry before I set out again.\r\n",
      "This is an all-nighter of a storm, if I know anything about it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Get dry, of course, Jerry-Jo. It won't take long with this heat; then we\r\n",
      "must start, storm or no storm.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old discomfort and unrest returned, and she fixed her eyes on\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's no great hurry,\" said he, munching away. \"It's warm here and\r\n",
      "cozy. What's got you, Priscilla? You was mighty keen to come, and you\r\n",
      "ain't finished your errand yet. What's ailing you? No one could help the\r\n",
      "storm, and we'd be swamped in the bay if we was there now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla got up and walked slowly toward the door, but without any\r\n",
      "apparent reason Jerry-Jo arose also, and, still chewing his bread and\r\n",
      "meat, backed away from the table, keeping himself between the girl and\r\n",
      "whatever her object was. Noticing this, a real terror seized upon\r\n",
      "Priscilla and she darted in the opposite direction, reached the hearth,\r\n",
      "and was bending toward a heavy poker which lay there, before she herself\r\n",
      "could have explained her motive. Jerry-Jo was alert. Tossing his food\r\n",
      "upon the table as he strode forward, he gripped her wrist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None of that!\" he muttered. \"What ails you, Priscilla?\" They faced each\r\n",
      "other at close range.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I am afraid of you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this McAlpin threw back his head and roared with laughter, releasing\r\n",
      "her at the same time. With freedom Priscilla gained a bit of courage and\r\n",
      "a keen sense of the necessity of calmness. She did not move away from\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo, but fixing him with her wide eyes she asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are--are the--family here--here in Kenmore?\" Suspicion and anger shook\r\n",
      "the voice. The slow, tense words brought things down to fact.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No! God knows where they are! I don't know or care.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Brought face to face with great danger, mental or physical, the majority\r\n",
      "of people rise to the call. Priscilla knew now that she was in grave\r\n",
      "peril--peril of a deeper kind than even her tormentor could realize.\r\n",
      "Every nerve and emotion came to her defence. She would hold this creature\r\n",
      "at bay as hunters hold the wild things of the woods when gun or club\r\n",
      "fail. Then, after that, she would have to deal with what must inevitably\r\n",
      "confront her at home. She seemed to be standing alone amid cruel and\r\n",
      "unfamiliar foes, but she was calm!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You lied, then? What for?\"\r\n",

      "\"Something like that, yes. You'll come to me fast enough, after to-night.\r\n",

      "Priscilla kept the fire alive. She laid the sticks and logs on\r\n",
      "cautiously; she turned wide eyes now and again on the tall clock whose\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Outside the storm sobbed itself into silence; the rain dripped\r\n",

      "the new day, rosy and full of cheer, made itself felt in the dim room\r\n",
      "where Priscilla, breathing evenly and softly, still slept. No gleam of\r\n",
      "brightness made its way through the heavy shutters or curtains, but a\r\n",
      "consciousness of day at last roused the sleeper. At first the experience\r\n",
      "through which she had passed made no demand upon her. She got painfully\r\n",
      "upon her feet and looked about. The fire was but embers, the air was hot\r\n",
      "and stifling, and then, with the thought of opening a door or window, the\r\n",
      "grim spectre of the black hours lay warning touch upon her. She shrank\r\n",
      "back and began again to--wait! Of course McAlpin would return--and what\r\n",
      "lay before her when he did? Her strength was spent, lack of food----And\r\n",
      "here her eyes fell on the broken fragments of stale bread and meat that\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo had tossed aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She took the morsels and devoured them eagerly; the nerves of the stomach\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The moments passed slowly, but presently, with the knowledge that day lay\r\n",
      "beyond her prison, she gained a new, a more desperate courage. If she\r\n",
      "must die, she would die in the open, where she at least might test her\r\n",
      "pitiful strength against Jerry-Jo's did he pursue her. The determination\r\n",
      "to act gave relief. The dark, damp room she could no longer bear; the\r\n",
      "lamp had hours before ceased to burn; the smell of stale oil smoke was\r\n",
      "sickening. No matter what happened she felt she must make a break for\r\n",
      "freedom. She knew full well that should Jerry-Jo enter now she could not\r\n",
      "combat him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, for the first time, she wondered why no one had come to seek her\r\n",
      "through the long, black hours of the night. The men of Kenmore never\r\n",
      "permitted a wanderer to remain unsought; there was danger. Why, even her\r\n",
      "father could not be so--so hard as to sleep undisturbed while she was\r\n",
      "unhoused! And her mother? Oh! surely her mother would have roused the\r\n",
      "people! And Anton Farwell? Why, he would have started at once, as he\r\n",
      "had for the McAdam boys. And with that conclusion came a new hope:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If they are searching it will be on the water!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course. Cheered by this thought, Priscilla made her way silently\r\n",
      "toward the door. With trembling fingers she turned the key and pushed\r\n",
      "gently outward. Through the crack the sun poured, and oh, the fresh\r\n",
      "sweetness of the morning air! Again she pushed, once again, and then with\r\n",
      "a rush she dashed through and was a hundred feet down the path when a\r\n",
      "loud laugh stayed her like a shot from a gun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She turned and braced herself against a tree for support. Jerry-Jo,\r\n",
      "pressed close to the house and not a foot from the door through which she\r\n",
      "had come, again shrieked with laughter. Presently he conquered himself,\r\n",
      "and, without moving, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're free! The canoe's ready for you, too. Go home--if you want--go\r\n",
      "home and get what's coming to you! I've been busy. There's a boat\r\n",
      "stopping at the wharf to-night. I'm leaving for the States. I've told\r\n",
      "them, as will pass it on, that you and me are going together. I'll stand\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"My--my father will kill you when he knows of this night!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla flung the words back savagely. She knew now that she was\r\n",
      "free--free for what? Again Jerry-Jo's laugh taunted her, and as she\r\n",
      "turned to the path her father faded from her hope. Only Anton Farwell\r\n",
      "seemed to loom high. Just and resourceful, he would help her!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The soggy, mossy path made heavy travelling for weary, nervous feet, but\r\n",
      "at the foot of the hill Priscilla saw the little canoe bobbing at the\r\n",
      "side of the dock. Once out upon the sunlit water the soul-horror\r\n",
      "disappeared and the task before her appeared easy. Now that the real\r\n",
      "danger was past, her physical demands seemed simple and well within her\r\n",
      "control. If her father turned her away--and as she drew near to Lonely\r\n",

      "him, with his assistance, go to the States. The time had come--that was\r\n",
      "all--the time had come! She was as ready as she ever would be. She had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The only signs of anxiety in evidence about the house were Nathaniel's\r\n",

      "Long Jean had already started. He had been out alone most of the night on\r\n",

      "she would have protected herself from her father's thought; as it was she\r\n",
      "could only summon enough strength to parry his questions with truthful\r\n",
      "answers, and until it was too late she did not realize how they damned\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop! Do you think that is all? Do you think I would have stayed\r\n",

      "I'll do it for your mother's sake and my good name. He shall marry you,\r\n",
      "by God! Say the word and I'll bring him here.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you would _force_ me to marry Jerry-Jo even against his will?\r\n",

      "big arms wide, as if pushing his child out--out!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With white face but blazing eyes Priscilla got up and went over to her\r\n",
      "mother. She drew the bowed and quivering form toward her and looked\r\n",
      "straight into the tear-flooded eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mother, tell me, do you believe me--dishonoured?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The contact of the dear, strong young body gave Theodora power to say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! my dear, my dear, I cannot, I will not believe evil of you. But you\r\n",
      "must do what your father thinks best; it is the only way. You have been\r\n",
      "so heedless, my child, my poor child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--side with her?\" thundered Nathaniel, feeling himself defied. \"Then\r\n",
      "heed me! If she refuses, out you go with her! No longer will I live with\r\n",
      "my family divided against me. The world with her, or the home with me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "cruel face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have only to tell you,\" she said slowly and with deadly hardness, \"you\r\n",
      "will not have to force Jerry-Jo McAlpin to marry me; he's eager enough to\r\n",
      "do it. He leaves to-night for the States; he has arranged for me to go\r\n",
      "with him.\" She paused, then went on, speaking now to her mother:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As God hears me, I am not dishonoured, little mother. I will never bring\r\n",
      "dishonour upon you. I could have explained to you--you would have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"This is the only way.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, you--you are not yet wedded.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must leave that to Jerry-Jo and me. And now a kiss--and the dear\r\n",
      "cheek against mine. So!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you will come back----\" Theodora sank gently to the floor. She had\r\n",
      "fainted quite away!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla bent with her, she lifted the white head to her knee, and again\r\n",
      "addressed her father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are satisfied?\" she asked. The shield was down between them. Man and\r\n",
      "woman, they stared, understandingly, in each other's eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Leave her to me!\" commanded Nathaniel, and strode toward the prostrate\r\n",
      "form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You've lied first and last. Neither McAlpin nor any other honest man\r\n",

      "\"I will go and--my hate I leave with you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when Theodora opened her eyes she was lying on the rough couch in the\r\n",
      "sunny kitchen, and Nathaniel was bathing her face with cool water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The child?\" faltered the mother, looking pleadingly around. And then\r\n",
      "Nathaniel showed mercy, the only mercy in his power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's gone to McAlpin. They leave for the States to-night. It's you and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! but if you had only been kinder. It seems as if we haven't gone\r\n",

      "done--wrong! With the acceptance of this, a strange thing happened.\r\n",
      "Curiosity, even interest, departed. For no reason that she could have\r\n",

      "only support. She would keep and hold to what she believed him, what he\r\n",
      "had been since he came to the In-Place. It was childish, blind perhaps,\r\n",

      "doubts you. No, no, lie quiet. I do not want to see you as you remember\r\n",
      "yourself; you are better as you are. I will not hear; I will not have it\r\n",
      "in my thought when I am far away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hardness passed from Farwell's face. Something like relief replaced\r\n",

      "\"My God! what a woman you will make if they do not harry you to death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They will not!\" The white, tired face seemed illumined from within.\r\n",
      "\"Last night made me so sure--of myself. It showed me how weak I was,\r\n",
      "and how strong. Do you know\"--and here a flush, not of ignorance,\r\n",
      "but of strange understanding, struck across Priscilla's face like a\r\n",
      "flame--\"women like my mother, all the women here in Kenmore, do not\r\n",
      "understand? They just let people take from them what no one has a right\r\n",
      "to take, what only they should give! It's when this something is taken\r\n",
      "that they become like my poor mother--afraid and crushed. If I live and\r\n",
      "die alone and lonely, I shall keep what is my own until I--I give it\r\n",
      "gladly and because I trust. I am not afraid! But if I had married\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo because of--of--what he and my father thought, then I would have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Stay here. The thing you want isn't worth the struggle. There is no use\r\n",

      "it that you must have?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla laughed--a wild, dreary little sound it was, but it dashed hope\r\n",
      "from Farwell's mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want my chance, a woman's chance, and I cannot have it here. I'm not\r\n",
      "going to hide under Mrs. McAdam's wing, or even yours, Master Farwell.\r\n",
      "I've left all the comfort with my poor mother that I can. Never let her\r\n",

      "where it leads, it is mine, and I am not afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In her ignorance and defiance she was splendid and stirred the dead\r\n",
      "embers of Farwell's imagination to something like life. If she were\r\n",
      "bent upon her course, if his hand could not rest upon the tiller of her\r\n",

      "turn?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is there not one, Master Farwell, just one, out beyond the In-Place,\r\n",
      "who, for your sake, would help me at first until I learned the way?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question chimed in with Farwell's thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He leaned across the table separating him from Priscilla Glenn and asked\r\n",
      "suddenly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can you keep a secret?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Promptly, emphatically, the answer came. \"Yes, I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then listen! You must stay here, hide yourself, keep yourself as best\r\n",
      "you may, while I go to--make arrangements. I will be no longer than I can\r\n",
      "help, but it will take time. The house is well stocked; make yourself\r\n",
      "comfortable. There are days when no one knows whether I am here or\r\n",
      "elsewhere. Protect yourself until I return. And when\"--Farwell paused and\r\n",
      "moistened his lips--\"when you are over the border, in the whirlpool, the\r\n",
      "past, this life, must be forgotten. Raise up a high wall, Priscilla, that\r\n",
      "no one can scale. Begin your new life from the hour you reach the States.\r\n",
      "The one who will befriend you need know no more than I tell him; others\r\n",
      "must take you on faith. At any moment your father, or some one like\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo, might hound you unless you live behind a shield. You\r\n",
      "understand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not plead for his own safety, and he was, at that moment, humanly\r\n",
      "thinking of hers alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you get the worst of it, come back; but leave the gate open only\r\n",
      "for--yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes.\" And now Priscilla's eyes were shining like stars. \"I will do\r\n",
      "all that you say; I feel so brave and strong and sure. I want the test,\r\n",
      "and I will leave the door to Kenmore ajar until the day when I can push\r\n",
      "it wide and enter as I will, taking or bringing my dear friends with me.\r\n",
      "I see\"--she paused and her eyes grew misty--\"I see My Road, stretching on\r\n",
      "and on, and it ends--oh, Master Farwell, it ends in my Heart's Desire!\"\r\n",
      "She was childishly elated and excited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell was fascinated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your Heart's Desire?\" he muttered; \"and what is that?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who knows until--she sees it? Hurry! hurry! Master Farwell, I long to\r\n",
      "set forth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Forgotten was her recent experience of horror; fading already was Kenmore\r\n",
      "from her sight. Danger by the way did not daunt her; the man bowed before\r\n",
      "her was but a blurred speck upon her vanishing horizon; then suddenly a\r\n",
      "sound caught her ear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you--are\"--she arose and stood beside Farwell, her hand upon his\r\n",
      "bent shoulder--\"you are crying; and for why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Loneliness, remorse, and fear for _you_, poor child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then Priscilla came back to the grim room and the cowering form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will bring happiness to you,\" she whispered; \"this I swear. In some\r\n",
      "way you shall be happy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Farwell shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To bed,\" he said suddenly; \"to bed, girl, and to sleep. I'll take a nap\r\n",
      "out here on the couch. Before you awake I'll be on my way. Keep the\r\n",
      "shades drawn; it's my way of saying I do not wish to be disturbed. Good\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About two in the morning Farwell set out upon his business for Priscilla.\r\n",
      "He left a safe and roaring fire upon the hearth; the window shades he did\r\n",
      "not raise, and well he knew that with that signal of desire for privacy\r\n",
      "his house would be passed by without apparent notice. The smoke might\r\n",
      "curl from the chimney, the dogs might, or might not, materialize, but\r\n",
      "with those close-drawn shades the simple courtesy of Kenmore would\r\n",
      "protect the master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was sleeping when Farwell silently closed the door after him,\r\n",
      "and, followed by his dogs, provided with food and blankets, he\r\n",
      "noiselessly took to the shadowy woods. It was a starry, still hour,\r\n",
      "lying between night and morning, and it partook of both. Dark it was, but\r\n",
      "with that silvery luminosity which a couple of hours later would be\r\n",
      "changed to pink glow. The stars shone, and the one great, pulsing planet\r\n",
      "that hung over the sleeping village seemed more gloriously near than\r\n",
      "Farwell had ever before noticed it. All nature was waiting for the magic\r\n",
      "touch of day; soon action and colour and sound would stir; just then the\r\n",
      "hush and breathlessness were a strange setting for the lonely man moving\r\n",
      "forward into the deeper shadows followed close by his faithful dogs. This\r\n",
      "man who, in the mad passion of his blighted youth, had taken life as if\r\n",
      "it were but one of the many things over which he claimed supremacy, with\r\n",
      "bowed head and slow steps, was going on an errand of mercy; he was going\r\n",
      "to claim, for a helpless human creature, assistance from the only man in\r\n",
      "all God's world upon whom he could call with hope of success.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The program, the next few days, was as clear in Farwell's mind as if he\r\n",
      "had already followed it from start to finish. By eight Pine would be on\r\n",
      "his tracks; by noon they would be together, the dogs grumbling and\r\n",
      "fighting at their heels. Two nights by the fire, smoking in a dull\r\n",
      "silence, broken now and then, in sheer desperation, by Farwell himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In Ledyard's plan there had evidently been but one stipulation: the\r\n",
      "constant guardianship with explicit reports. Beyond that there seemed to\r\n",
      "be no exactions. Farwell had tried to make Pine drink more than was good\r\n",
      "for him on various occasions in order to test the metal of the restraint,\r\n",
      "but the Indian displayed a wonderful self-control. He knew when and where\r\n",
      "to begin and stop in any self-indulgence, but having fulfilled his part\r\n",
      "he showed no interest or curiosity in his companion. Once the trading\r\n",
      "station was reached, Farwell might buy or seek pleasure as he chose; he\r\n",
      "might write or receive letters; might sleep or wake. So long as the\r\n",
      "tangible Farwell was where the guide could locate him at a moment's\r\n",
      "notice, he was free to think and act to his own satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he plodded on Farwell contemplated, as he never had before, his\r\n",
      "relations with the Indian; in fact, the Indian himself. A superficial\r\n",
      "friendliness had sprung up between the two. How deep was it? how much to\r\n",
      "be depended upon? If Ledyard could buy the fellow, might not a higher\r\n",
      "price secure his allegiance? This, strange to say, was a new thought to\r\n",
      "Farwell. Perhaps he had accepted the situation too doggedly; it was his\r\n",
      "way to cease struggling when the tide turned against him. It was\r\n",
      "weakness, it was folly, and, after Priscilla went, after the girl opened\r\n",
      "the doors again into that old life, how could he endure the loneliness,\r\n",
      "the tugging of her hold upon him from the place he once had called his?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day came late to the deep woods beyond Kenmore, and Farwell seemed\r\n",
      "going toward the night instead of facing the morning. At five he paused\r\n",
      "to feed his dogs and take a bite himself, and, as he sat upon a fallen\r\n",
      "tree, the mystic stirrings of life thrilled him as they often had before.\r\n",
      "It was more a sense of rustle and awakening than actual sound. Hidden\r\n",
      "under the silence of the forest lay the quivering promises, as the rosy\r\n",
      "light lay just on the border of the woodland. Both were pressing warm and\r\n",
      "comfortingly close to the lonely man with his patient dogs at his feet.\r\n",
      "Farwell was a better man, a finer man, than he knew, but only\r\n",
      "subconsciously did this support him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was three of the afternoon before he heard the quick, measured steps\r\n",
      "on the trail behind him. He did not turn his head, but he called back a\r\n",
      "genial \"Hello!\" which was answered by a grunt not devoid of friendliness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The evening meal was eaten together, and the two arranged their blankets\r\n",
      "near the fire for the night's rest. Farwell's two dogs and Pine's one\r\n",
      "faithful henchman lay down in peace a short distance away. It was as it\r\n",
      "had been for a time back, except that the Indian had become, suddenly,\r\n",
      "either an obstacle to be overcome or a friend to assist. Not realizing\r\n",
      "his new importance, the guide grunted a good night and fell into that\r\n",
      "sleep of his that never seemed to capture his senses entirely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the small town, which was reached late the following day, Farwell\r\n",
      "engaged two rooms at the ramshackle tavern and informed Pine that he was\r\n",
      "to share the luxuries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was unusual. In the past a day at the station sufficed for business\r\n",
      "transactions, and night found them in the woods again. Pine was confused\r\n",
      "but alert. However, things progressed comfortably enough. The expected\r\n",
      "mail was awaiting Farwell, and he greedily bought all the newspapers he\r\n",
      "could get. His purchases at the store did not interest the Indian and he\r\n",
      "was not even aware that several garments for a woman were included in\r\n",
      "Farwell's list. A telegram sent, and another received, did perturb the\r\n",
      "fellow a good deal, but when Farwell tore the one he got into shreds, the\r\n",
      "simple mind of the guide concluded that the matter was unimportant, and\r\n",
      "he forgot it before they reached Kenmore. He could not burden his poor\r\n",
      "intellect with unnecessary rubbish, and the whole business was getting on\r\n",
      "to what stood for nerves in the Indian's anatomy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What really had occurred was this: Farwell had reached across the\r\n",
      "desolate stretches that divided him from his one friend and got a\r\n",
      "response. He had impressed upon John Boswell that he could not come in\r\n",
      "person to Kenmore, but he could meet a certain needy young person and\r\n",
      "convey her to safety in the States. And he had asked a question that for\r\n",
      "months had never risen to the surface--he had been too crushed to give it\r\n",
      "place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is Joan Moss still alive?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell was ready to aid him in any way, would even deny himself the\r\n",
      "longing of seeing his old friend face to face, since that seemed\r\n",
      "desirable. He would meet the young woman at a place called Little Corners\r\n",
      "and would do what he could for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Joan Moss is still alive.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A strong light and a new hope came into Farwell's sad eyes. He had a hold\r\n",
      "on the future! With the possibility of supplanting Ledyard in Pine's\r\n",
      "ideas of loyalty and economics what might not happen?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so they started back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was midnight, four days after Farwell had left home, that he entered\r\n",
      "his own door again. The return trip had been rushed, much to Pine's\r\n",
      "approbation. Priscilla was quietly sewing at the table when Farwell,\r\n",
      "having loudly bidden the Indian good night, came into the living-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl's alarmed glance turned to one of relieved welcome when she saw\r\n",
      "Farwell. She had some food ready for him--every night she had been\r\n",
      "prepared--and he ate it ravenously. She noted how white and weary he\r\n",
      "looked, but the triumphant expression in his sad eyes did not escape her,\r\n",
      "either.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have good news?\" she asked as soon as Farwell had rested a bit by\r\n",
      "his fireside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. And you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! I have done famously. Only two knocks at the door, and I was well\r\n",
      "hidden. Once it was Mrs. McAdam and once old Jerry. They did not try to\r\n",
      "enter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They would not. And there was food and fuel enough?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Food--yes; I went out three times for wood, and I took one wild, mad\r\n",
      "walk. I ran, while all the world slept, to Lonely Farm. I looked in at my\r\n",
      "father's window; he was dozing by the fire, and--my mother----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Priscilla?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My mother--was crying! I shall always remember her--crying. I did not\r\n",
      "know there were so many tears in the world!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you still insist upon going away?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. There is no other way for me. Already I seem a stranger, a\r\n",
      "passerby. Not even for my mother can I stay; it could work no good for\r\n",
      "her or me. Perhaps, by and by----\" Priscilla paused. Now that she was\r\n",
      "about to turn her back on all that was familiar to her, she became\r\n",
      "serious and intense, but she knew no shadow of wavering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Farwell told her the arrangements he had made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a hundred dollars for you, Priscilla. I wish it were more. My\r\n",
      "friend Boswell will meet you at Little Corners. This is Friday; he will\r\n",
      "be there on Sunday and will wait for you at the inn; there is only one.\r\n",
      "Ask for it and go straight to it. From here to Little Corners is the\r\n",
      "hardest part. I will go as far as I dare with you; the rest you must make\r\n",
      "alone. Halfway, there is a deserted shanty near the old factory; there\r\n",
      "you can make yourself comfortable for the night. Are you afraid?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was white and intent, but she answered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I shall not be afraid.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ought to cover the distance in a couple of days and a night; the\r\n",
      "walking is not hard, and the woods are fairly well cleared. Once you\r\n",
      "reach Boswell you are safe. He will not question you, but you can trust\r\n",
      "him. He's a strange man--younger than I; he stands, has always stood, for\r\n",
      "all that is noble and good in my life. I have told him that you are some\r\n",
      "one in whom I am interested.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The feeling of adventure closed in and clutched the girl. Now that the\r\n",
      "hour had actually come, the hour up to which all her preparations tended,\r\n",
      "she quivered with excitement tinged with sadness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This way of leaving Kenmore is safer,\" Farwell was saying. \"If any one\r\n",
      "were to see you and know you, your father would find you out and bring\r\n",
      "you back. No one will know you at Little Corners. That's a place which\r\n",
      "most honest people let alone. You'll like Boswell--every one does--after\r\n",
      "the first. He'll put you in the way of helping yourself, and your people\r\n",
      "may still hold their belief about you and Jerry-Jo, since it makes things\r\n",
      "easier for them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; they must believe that until----\" But Priscilla did not finish the\r\n",
      "sentence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two sat silent for a few minutes while the tired dogs upon the hearth\r\n",
      "breathed loud and evenly. Then at last Priscilla asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When do we start, Master Farwell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Start? Oh, to be sure. I had forgotten.\" Farwell roused himself from his\r\n",
      "lethargy. \"We start at once; in an hour or two at the latest. I will nap\r\n",
      "here on the couch; you must rest as best you can. There's a long coat and\r\n",
      "a hat in yonder bundle. They must serve you until you meet Boswell. He'll\r\n",
      "rig you out in some town before you reach civilization. Here's the money;\r\n",
      "take wallet and all. Hide it somewhere, Priscilla.\" Farwell was on his\r\n",
      "feet and active once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go in an hour or two?\" gasped Priscilla absentmindedly, following\r\n",
      "Farwell's words and accepting the money with a long, tender look of\r\n",
      "gratitude. \"In an hour or two? Why, you've only just come in, Master\r\n",
      "Farwell!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What matters? After to-morrow I shall have time to rest and sleep to my\r\n",
      "fill.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You will--miss me, Master Farwell?\" Priscilla's eyes were dim. \"I would\r\n",
      "like to have some one--miss me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall, indeed, miss you! You can never understand what you have meant\r\n",
      "to me, Priscilla. I cannot make you understand; I shall not try; but in\r\n",
      "helping you I have perhaps helped myself. I cannot walk out of the\r\n",
      "In-Place beside you, as I would like to do--not now. Maybe a long time\r\n",
      "hence, some day, I may follow!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell's excitement showed in his eyes and voice and wiped out the\r\n",
      "weariness of his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You mean that, Master Farwell? You are not trying to comfort me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; I am comforting myself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, forgetful of the need for sleep, he went on rapidly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Out where you are going, Priscilla, there is a--a woman I love; she once\r\n",
      "loved me. This must seem queer to you who have only known me as--as I now\r\n",
      "seem. I will seem different to you when you have wakened up--seen other\r\n",
      "kinds of men and women.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is she young--pretty?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The senseless words escaped Priscilla's lips because quivering interest\r\n",
      "and a strange embarrassment held her thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I do not know--how she is now. She _was_ pretty. Good God! how pretty\r\n",
      "she was, and young, and kind, too. It was the kindness that mattered\r\n",
      "most. You see, she thinks me dead; it was best so. I--I had to be dead\r\n",
      "for a while and then I meant to go to her myself. But--something\r\n",
      "happened. I was obliged to stay on here, and she might not have\r\n",
      "understood. I'd like----\" Farwell paused and looked pleadingly at the\r\n",
      "white girl-face across the rude table, where the fragments of food still\r\n",
      "lay: \"I'd like you to go and see her. Boswell could take you. He's done\r\n",
      "everything for her, God bless him! I'd--I'd like to have you tell her\r\n",
      "gently, kindly, that I am alive. You might say it so as to spare her\r\n",
      "shock; you might, better than any one else!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The longing in the man's eyes was almost more than Priscilla could\r\n",
      "endure. Crude as she was, wrong and sinful as the man near her may at one\r\n",
      "time have been, she knew intuitively that the love for that woman in the\r\n",
      "States had been his consuming and uplifting passion. If he had sinned for\r\n",
      "her, he had also died for her, and now he pleaded for resurrection in her\r\n",
      "life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will do anything in all the world for you, Master Farwell; anything!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Priscilla stretched her hands out impulsively. Farwell took them in\r\n",
      "his cold, thin ones and clung to her grimly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd like to know she'd welcome me!\" he whispered. \"Unless she could, I'd\r\n",
      "rather stay--dead!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another silence fell between the man and girl while he relived the past\r\n",
      "and she sought to enter the future.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clock struck the half-hour of one and Farwell sprang up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Get ready!\" he said. \"No time for napping now. It is--it is Saturday\r\n",
      "morning! We must be off! I'll go with you as far as I can. For the\r\n",
      "rest----\" He stopped suddenly and looked blankly at Priscilla.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little after two they started away from the small, darkened house. It\r\n",
      "was a cloudy morning; day would be long in coming, and the two made the\r\n",
      "most of the darkness. They were well in the deep woods by six o'clock; at\r\n",
      "seven they ate some food Farwell had hurriedly prepared, and were on\r\n",
      "their way again by eight. They did not talk much. Priscilla found that\r\n",
      "she needed all her strength, now that she must soon depend upon herself,\r\n",
      "and Farwell had nothing more to say but--good-bye!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anton Farwell had got ahead of his spy for once! Not even so\r\n",
      "indefatigable an Indian as Pine could be expected to watch a man who had\r\n",
      "just returned from a long tramp. But Farwell knew full well that by high\r\n",
      "noon his guard would have sensed danger and be uncommonly active, so he\r\n",
      "pushed the march to Priscilla's utmost limit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At four o'clock they reached the deserted hut near the old factory. A\r\n",
      "fire was made upon the hearth and a broken-down settle drawn close.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'd rest until early morning,\" advised Farwell in a hard, constrained\r\n",
      "voice. \"Good Lord, Priscilla, it's a cruel place to leave you--alone!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall not mind, Master Farwell.\" All that was brave and unselfish in\r\n",
      "the girl rose now to the fore. She recognized that Farwell, even more\r\n",
      "than she, needed comfort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall never forget you,\" she said, holding her hands out to him;\r\n",
      "\"never forget you or cease to--love you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last words made him wince.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Good-bye, Master Farwell.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the door closed upon the man, for a moment Priscilla stood with\r\n",
      "horrified glance following him. The sense of high adventure perished at\r\n",
      "his going. Alone in the woods, in the ghostly hut, the night to face, and\r\n",
      "the blank future stretching beyond! It was more than she could bear, and\r\n",
      "a cry escaped her parted lips. But Farwell did not hear, and the paroxysm\r\n",
      "passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla slept that night, slept well and safely, and the early light of\r\n",
      "Sunday morning found her refreshed and full of courage. She never knew\r\n",
      "that two hours after leaving her Farwell met Pine and found in him--a\r\n",
      "friend!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had come face to face on a side trail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here I am!\" said Farwell cheerfully; then he took his place in front of\r\n",
      "the guide. That had always been the unspoken understanding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here, Pine, we've never said much to each other about what--all this\r\n",
      "means, but I want to say something now. I won't give you much trouble in\r\n",
      "the future. I shall not go often for my mail, or necessaries. In return,\r\n",
      "forget _this_ journey. I went to let a--a poor little devil of a creature\r\n",
      "out of a trap. That is all. I just couldn't--leave it to suffer--and I\r\n",

      "excessively British, as so many Canadians are, but he was a broad-minded\r\n",
      "man in his sympathies, and a friend to all--when it paid. He was a man of\r\n",
      "keen perceptions, of conveniently short memory, and had the capacity for\r\n",
      "giving a lie all the virtuous appearance of truth and frankness. Goodale\r\n",
      "had no family, and, as far as possible, served his guests himself. A\r\n",

      "thanklessness of the task of getting ready for people who might never\r\n",
      "appear, when, to his delight, he saw a team of weary horses advancing. He\r\n",
      "had time only to put his features in order for business when a man\r\n",
      "entered the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one but Goodale could have taken the shock of the traveller's\r\n",
      "personality in just the way he did. The smile froze on his face, his eyes\r\n",
      "beamed, and his stiff, red hair seemed bristling with welcome. \"Advance\r\n",
      "agent of a circus,\" he thought; \"sort of advertising guy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man who had entered was about three feet tall, horribly twisted as to\r\n",
      "legs, and humped as to back and chest. The long, thin arms reached below\r\n",
      "the bent knees, and large, white hands dangled from them as if attached\r\n",
      "by wires. The big head, set low on the shoulders, seemed to have no\r\n",
      "connecting link of neck. It was a great, shaggy head with deep-set,\r\n",
      "wonderful eyes, sensitive mouth and chin, and a handsome nose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, sir, delighted,\" said Goodale. \"Shall I tell your driver to go to\r\n",
      "the stables?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm my own driver, but I'd like your man to see to the horses. I'm John\r\n",
      "Boswell from New York, though you'll probably forget that an hour after I\r\n",
      "leave.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goodale nodded. This was quite in his line, and he suddenly became aware\r\n",
      "of the exquisite texture and quality of the stranger's clothing; the\r\n",
      "fineness of the piping voice. All sorts came to the inn, but this last\r\n",
      "comer was a gentleman, for all his defects.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm expecting a young woman, a distant relative, from farther back in\r\n",
      "Canada. I shall await her here. My stay is uncertain. Make me as\r\n",
      "comfortable as you can; I like to be comfortable.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you are alone, sir?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Until the young lady comes, yes. She is to return to the States with me.\r\n",
      "It depends upon her how soon we travel back.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This did away with the show business, but it added romance to the\r\n",
      "adventure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goodale made Boswell extremely comfortable, surprisingly so. Two bedrooms\r\n",
      "were got in order as if by magic; a little sitting-room emerged from\r\n",
      "behind closed doors; an apartment quite detached and cozy, with a\r\n",
      "generous fireplace and accommodations for private meals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a good dinner Boswell went for a stroll, telling his host to make\r\n",
      "the young lady welcome upon her arrival.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past four Priscilla Glenn walked into the office of the inn. She\r\n",
      "was tired and worn, rather unkempt as to appearance, but she stepped\r\n",
      "erect and with some dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is--is Mr. Boswell here?\" she asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He is, and then again he ain't,\" smiled Timothy, who was always playful\r\n",
      "with women when he wasn't brutal. None knew better than he the use and\r\n",
      "abuse of chivalry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are to make yourself at home, Miss; then I'll serve tea in the\r\n",
      "sitting parlour; all quite your own and no fear of intrusion. I'm host\r\n",
      "and servant to my guests. I never trust them to--to menials.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where's my room?\" Priscilla broke in abruptly. She was near the\r\n",
      "breaking-point and she longed for privacy and shelter before she\r\n",
      "collapsed. Her tone and manner antagonized Goodale. He understood and\r\n",
      "recognized only two classes of women, and this girl's attitude did not\r\n",
      "fit either class. In silence he showed her to her bedchamber, and once\r\n",
      "the door separated him from her his smile departed and he relieved his\r\n",
      "feelings by muttering a name not complimentary to Mr. Boswell's relative.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sense of safety, warmth, and creature comforts speedily brought about\r\n",
      "courage and hope to Priscilla; a childish curiosity consumed her; she was\r\n",
      "disappointed that Boswell did not present himself, but his absence gave\r\n",
      "her time for rallying her forces. She found her way to the little\r\n",
      "sitting-room by six o'clock, and, to her delight, saw that tea things\r\n",
      "were on a table by the hearth and a kettle was boiling over the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And so--this is Miss Priscilla Glenn?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So noiselessly had the man entered the room through the open door, so\r\n",
      "kind and gentle his voice, that, though the girl started, she felt no\r\n",
      "fear until her eyes fell upon the speaker. Boswell waited. He knew what\r\n",
      "must follow. Readjustment always took time. In this case the time might\r\n",
      "be longer because of the crudity of the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" The shuddering word escaped the trembling lips and the tightly\r\n",
      "clasped hands that had instinctively gone to the face. \"Ah!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man by the door sent forth a pitiful appeal for mercy and acceptance\r\n",
      "in so sweet and rare a smile that for very shame Priscilla stood up and\r\n",
      "smiled back wanly and apologetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell liked the attempt and ready willingness; they showed character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now that that is over,\" he said in his strange, fine voice, \"we may sit\r\n",
      "down and be friends. May we not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will make fresh tea for you--please let me!\" for Boswell was waving\r\n",
      "aside the suggestion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well! Weak--just flavoured water. Now, then!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sidling form edged to the deep chair beside the hearth and scrambled\r\n",
      "up, using both hands as a child does. Priscilla kept her eyes upon her\r\n",
      "task and struggled for composure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I suppose Max--I mean Farwell--did not describe me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was mistaken kindness. My friends have a habit of doing that. They\r\n",
      "think to spare me; it only makes it harder. Try to forget, as soon as\r\n",
      "you can, my ugly shell; I am commonplace beneath.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pathos of this almost brought tears to Priscilla Glenn's eyes. Her\r\n",
      "warm, sympathetic nature responded generously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I am very sorry I gave you pain, sir. Forgive me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We will not mention it again. If you can think of me as--a man, a friend\r\n",
      "who wishes to help you for another friend's sake, you will honour me and\r\n",
      "make easier your own position. You see, you are no stranger to me; I have\r\n",
      "the advantage of you. Farwell has kept me in touch with you from your\r\n",
      "childhood up. You have amused him, helped him to bear many things that\r\n",
      "would have been harder for him without you. I thank you for this. I\r\n",
      "am Farwell's friend. Why, do you know\"--and now the deep eyes glowed\r\n",
      "kindly--\"he has even told me of that original religion you evolved from\r\n",
      "your needs; he pictured the strange god you worshipped. I've laughed over\r\n",
      "that many times.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your tea is getting cold, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was gaining control of her emotions, and John Boswell's evident\r\n",
      "determination to place her in a comfortable position won her gratitude\r\n",
      "and admiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I like cold tea; the colder and weaker the better. Thank you. Let the\r\n",
      "cup stand on the table; I will help myself presently. I sincerely hope\r\n",
      "we, you and I, are going to be friends. It would hurt Farwell so if we\r\n",
      "were not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How good you are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Goodness is--my profession.\" The drollery in the voice was more\r\n",
      "touching than amusing. \"I call myself the Property Man. I help people\r\n",
      "artistically, when I can. It is my one pleasure, and I find it most\r\n",
      "exciting. You will learn, now that you have taken your place on the stage\r\n",
      "of life, that the Property Man is very important.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this light talk, half serious, half playful, he reassured Priscilla\r\n",
      "and claimed for himself what his deformity often retarded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Already you seem my friend. Mr. Farwell said you would be.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla's eyes did not shrink now. The soul of the man had, in some\r\n",
      "subtle fashion, transformed him. She began to succumb to that power of\r\n",
      "Boswell's that had held many men and women even against their wills.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Farwell was always a dramatic fellow,\" the weak voice continued. \"When\r\n",
      "he sent me word, I wanted to go direct to Kenmore; I wanted to see him\r\n",
      "after all these years. But he had made his own plans in his own way.\r\n",
      "There were--reasons.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla looked bravely in the thin, kindly face. She remembered that\r\n",
      "Farwell had said that she need tell nothing more than she cared to, but\r\n",
      "an overpowering desire was growing upon her to confide everything to this\r\n",
      "friend of an hour. His deep, true eyes, fixed upon her, were challenging\r\n",
      "every doubt, every reserve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Farwell says you dance like a sprite.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Priscilla started as if from sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! a childish bit of play,\" she said. \"I--I have almost forgotten how\r\n",
      "to dance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope you will never forget. To dance and sing and laugh should be the\r\n",
      "heritage of all young things. You must forget to be serious, past the\r\n",
      "safety point! That's where danger lies. It does not pay to take our parts\r\n",
      "ponderously. I learned that long ago.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall be--happy after a while.\" And now, quite simply and frankly,\r\n",
      "Priscilla cast away her anchors of caution and timidity and spoke openly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I have been so troubled. Things have happened to me that should not\r\n",
      "have happened if--if my mother and father could have trusted in me. They\r\n",
      "believed--wrong of me when really they should have pitied me. You trust\r\n",
      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Absolutely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Master Farwell trusted me. As things were, the only comfort I could give\r\n",
      "my poor parents was to let them think I left Kenmore with--with a young\r\n",
      "man. Something had occurred that--looked wrong. It was only a terrible\r\n",
      "experience. No one helped me but Master Farwell. My--my people turned\r\n",
      "from me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was Farwell's way: to help where he had faith,\" murmured Boswell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The deep eyes were so perilously kind that Priscilla had to struggle to\r\n",
      "keep back her tears. A sense of security and peace flooded her heart, but\r\n",
      "the past strain had left its mark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My father would have been glad to have me marry the--the man. I would\r\n",
      "rather have died after what happened! They--my father and mother--must\r\n",
      "believe I have gone with him. It will at least make them feel I have not\r\n",
      "disgraced them. Now--you can understand!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perfectly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I want to go into training. I want to be a nurse. I am sure I can\r\n",
      "succeed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So very humble and modest was the ambition that it quite took Boswell by\r\n",
      "surprise. Priscilla did not notice the uplifting of the shaggy brows. She\r\n",
      "went on eagerly, thoughtfully:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see, I have only such education as Master Farwell has given me, but\r\n",
      "I have a ready mind, he says. I am sure I could watch and tend the sick.\r\n",
      "A lady staying in Kenmore at one time told me I had the--the touch of a\r\n",
      "skilled hand. I want--to help the world, somehow, and this seems the only\r\n",
      "way open to a girl like me. I am strong; I never tire. Yes; I want to be\r\n",
      "a nurse, the best one I can be.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell understood the deeper truth. This girl, original, artistic, was\r\n",
      "foregoing much in accepting this safe, humble course. She expected no\r\n",
      "charity, nothing but a helpful interest. It was unusual and delightful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a hundred dollars that Master Farwell gave me. It will help, and\r\n",
      "I can repay it by and by. I know it will be years before I can do so, but\r\n",
      "he understands. While I am studying there will be little expense, the\r\n",
      "lady told me. And oh!\"--here Priscilla interrupted herself suddenly--\"I\r\n",
      "have an errand to do for Master Farwell as soon as I get to New York. He\r\n",
      "told me you--would help me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An errand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. There is a--woman he once--loved; loves still. She thinks he--is\r\n",
      "dead. It was best so in the past. There was a reason for letting her\r\n",
      "believe so; but now he wants her--to know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell sprang up in his chair as if he were on a strong spring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wants you to go and tell her--that he still lives?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. It will be hard, but I will do it for him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell settled back in his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought he only meant her to know--when he could go himself,\" he said\r\n",
      "quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He made me promise.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell leaned forward and drew the cup from the table, and in one long\r\n",
      "draught drank the cold, weak tea. When he spoke again the conversation\r\n",
      "was set in a different channel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hardly know what I expected to find you, Miss Glenn,\" he said with his\r\n",
      "rare, sweet smile. \"You evidently seemed more a child to Farwell than you\r\n",
      "do to me. That was natural. Now that we have become acquainted I hope you\r\n",
      "will accept my help and hospitality until your own plans are formed. I\r\n",
      "can make you very comfortable in my town home. I am sure I can place you\r\n",
      "in the best training school in the city; I have some influence there. But\r\n",
      "before you settle to your hard work you will let me play host, as Farwell\r\n",
      "would in my place? This would be a great pleasure to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What there was in the words and tone Priscilla could never tell, but\r\n",
      "at once the future seemed secure, and the present placed on a sound\r\n",
      "foundation. Every disturbing element was eliminated and the whole\r\n",
      "situation put upon a perfectly commonplace basis. By a quick transition\r\n",
      "the unreality was swept aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed, I will be glad to accept.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They smiled quite frankly and happily at each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An odd story occurs to me.\" Boswell pressed back in his chair and his\r\n",
      "face was in shadow. \"You must get used to my stories and plays. The\r\n",
      "Property Man must have his sport. There was once a garden, very\r\n",
      "beautiful, very desirable, but full of traps to the unwary. Quite\r\n",
      "unexpectedly, one day, a particularly fine butterfly found herself poised\r\n",
      "on the branch of a tree with a soaring ambition in her heart, but a blind\r\n",
      "sense of danger, also. It was a wise butterfly, by way of change. While\r\n",
      "it hesitated, a beetle crawled along and offered its services as guide.\r\n",
      "The pretty, bright thing was sane enough to accept. Do you follow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla started. She had been caught in the mesh of the story, and now\r\n",
      "with a sudden realization of its underlying thought she flushed and\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I still have my childish delight in stories, you see,\" she said. Then,\r\n",
      "\"I--I do see what you mean. Again I repeat, I am so glad to accept\r\n",
      "your--your kindness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Middle life has its disadvantages.\" The voice from out the shadows\r\n",
      "sounded weary. \"It has none of the blindness of youth and none of the\r\n",
      "assurance of old age. If I were twenty, you and I could play together in\r\n",
      "the Garden; if I were ninety I could tuck you safely away in my nest and\r\n",
      "feed you on dainties, and no one could say a word. As it is--well, we'll\r\n",
      "do the best we can, and, after you are in your training, you'll be glad\r\n",
      "enough to have my nest to fly to for a change of air and an opportunity\r\n",
      "to chat with me. The Property Man will come in handy. Hark! the wind is\r\n",
      "rising. How it blows!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ashes were flying about on the hearth and the trees outside beat\r\n",
      "their branches against the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It never roars like that in the In-Place,\" whispered Priscilla, awed by\r\n",
      "the sound and fury that were rapidly gaining power.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The In-Place?\" Boswell sighed. \"What a blessed name! To think of any one\r\n",
      "fluttering about in the dangerous Garden when he or she might remain in\r\n",
      "the In-Place!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a tap on the door, and in reply to Boswell's \"Come!\" Goodale\r\n",

      "Priscilla Glenn always looked back on the next four weeks of her life as\r\n",
      "a transition stage between one incarnation and another. Kenmore, and that\r\n",
      "which had gone to the making of her life previous to her meeting with\r\n",
      "John Boswell, seemed to have accomplished their purpose and left her\r\n",
      "detached and finished, up to a certain point, for the next period of her\r\n",
      "existence. In the severing of all the ties of the past, even affection,\r\n",
      "gratitude, and memory, for the time being, were held in abeyance. This\r\n",
      "was a merciful state, for, had ordinary emotions and sentiments held her,\r\n",
      "she would have been unfitted for the difficult task of readjustment which\r\n",
      "she gradually achieved, simply because of her dulled mental and spiritual\r\n",
      "sensations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The noise and flash of the big city bewildered and dazzled the girl from\r\n",
      "the In-Place and encrusted her with an unreality that spared her many a\r\n",
      "pang of loss, and also fear for the future. Boswell's apartment, high\r\n",
      "above the street and overlooking the Hudson River and Palisades, became a\r\n",
      "veritable sanctuary from which she dreaded to emerge and to which she\r\n",
      "clung in a passion of self-preservation. The gray wall of stone across\r\n",
      "the sparkling stream grew to be, in her vivid fancy, the barrier between\r\n",
      "the past and future. Against it, unseen, faint, but persistent, beat what\r\n",
      "once had been--her grim father, her weak, tearful mother, lonely, kindly\r\n",
      "Master Farwell, and all the lesser folk of Kenmore. Pressing close and\r\n",
      "straining to hold her, these dim, shadowy memories clustered, but she no\r\n",
      "longer appeared a part of them, like them, or in any way connected with\r\n",
      "them. On the other hand, below the eyrie dwelling in which she was\r\n",
      "temporarily sheltered, lay the whirlpool of sound and motion into which,\r\n",
      "sooner or later, she must plunge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With keen appreciation and understanding of this phase of her\r\n",
      "development, John Boswell kept conversation and life upon the surface,\r\n",
      "and rarely permitted a letting-down of thought. Cautiously, and not too\r\n",
      "often, he took his guest on tours of inspection and watched her while she\r\n",
      "underwent new ordeals or experienced pain from unknown thrills. He had\r\n",
      "never been more interested or amused in his life, and, in his enthusiasm,\r\n",
      "exaggerated Priscilla's capabilities. He revelled in her frankness and\r\n",
      "her confidence; he learned from her more of Farwell than he could have\r\n",
      "learned in any other way, and his faithful heart throbbed in pity, pride,\r\n",
      "and affection for the lonely master of the In-Place, who, little heeding\r\n",
      "his own progress, had triumphed over his old and lesser self at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The home of Boswell was a large and sunny apartment high up in the huge\r\n",
      "building. Only one servant, a marvellously silent and efficient Japanese,\r\n",
      "ran the economic machinery, awesomely defended Boswell's library when the\r\n",
      "master retired to perform his mystic rites, and in all relations was\r\n",
      "exemplary. Poor Boswell's rites comprised a devouring appetite for\r\n",
      "reading and a rather happy talent for turning off a short story as unique\r\n",
      "and human as he was himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Priscilla Glenn arrived, Toky, as the servant was called, was\r\n",
      "tested to the uttermost. Never before had Boswell introduced a woman into\r\n",
      "the sphere sacred to Man. Toky disapproved, was utterly disgusted; he\r\n",
      "lost his implicit faith in his master's wisdom, but he adopted a manner\r\n",
      "at once so magnanimous and charming that Boswell set to work and planned\r\n",
      "future gifts of appreciation for his servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No other woman came to the apartment; Boswell shrank from them, not\r\n",
      "bitterly or resentfully, but sensitively. Men took him more or less for\r\n",
      "granted when he touched their lives; women overdid the determination, on\r\n",
      "their parts, to set him at ease. Long since he had turned his poor,\r\n",
      "misshapen back upon the very natural and legitimate desire for the happy\r\n",
      "mingling of both sexes, but after Priscilla Glenn became his guest he\r\n",
      "recognized the need of women friends in a sharp and painful manner. They\r\n",
      "could have helped him so much; could have solved so many problems for him\r\n",
      "and the girl; but as it was he had to do the best he could alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hundred dollars, still to be repaid to Farwell, worked wonders in the\r\n",
      "week following the arrival of the Beetle and the Butterfly, as Boswell\r\n",
      "insisted upon calling himself and Priscilla. Having no power at court,\r\n",
      "Boswell cast himself on the mercy of lesser folks and managed, by way of\r\n",
      "secret nods and whispers, to gain the cooeperation of sympathetic-looking\r\n",
      "shop girls in order to array Priscilla in garments that would secure her\r\n",
      "and him from impudent stares and offensive leers. The evenings following\r\n",
      "these shopping expeditions were devoted to \"casting up accounts.\"\r\n",
      "Priscilla was absolutely lacking in worldly wisdom, but she had a sense\r\n",
      "of accuracy that drove Boswell to the outer edge of veracity. Never\r\n",
      "having bought an article of clothing for herself, Priscilla attacked this\r\n",
      "new problem with perfectly blank faith. Prices often surprised and\r\n",
      "startled her by their smallness, but the results obtained were gloriously\r\n",
      "gratifying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can better understand the lure of the States now, Mr. Boswell,\" she\r\n",
      "said one evening as the two sat in the library with the wind howling\r\n",
      "down Boswell's exaggerations and the fire illuminating the girl's\r\n",
      "face. \"Kenmore prices were impossible, but one can go wild here for so\r\n",
      "little. Just fancy! That whole beautiful suit for two dollars and\r\n",
      "eighty-seven----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eighty-nine!\" Boswell severely broke in, shaking his pencil at her as he\r\n",
      "sat perched, like a benign gargoyle, by his study table. \"I'll not have\r\n",
      "Farwell defrauded while he cannot protect his own interests.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Two eighty-nine,\" Priscilla agreed, with a laugh so merry and carefree\r\n",
      "that the listener dropped his tired eyes. \"And how much does that leave\r\n",
      "of the hundred, Mr. Boswell? I tremble when I think of the silk gown so\r\n",
      "soft and pretty, the slippers and stockings to match, and the storm coat,\r\n",
      "umbrella, heavy shoes, and--and--other things.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell referred to his notes and long lines of figures.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All told, and in round numbers, there are forty-seven dollars and three\r\n",
      "cents left.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's marvellous! wonderful!\" Priscilla exclaimed. \"You are sure, Mr.\r\n",
      "Boswell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you doubt me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sometimes I do, you are so kind, so generous, and under ordinary\r\n",
      "circumstances it would seem impossible to buy things so cheap. You must\r\n",
      "select your shops carefully.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One has to on a moderate allowance.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then quite suddenly Priscilla Glenn spoke quickly and breathlessly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Boswell, I--I must begin my training. Have you made any\r\n",
      "arrangements? And, when I go, will they pay me from the start?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell grew grave as he thought of the knowledge that would come\r\n",
      "concerning dollars and cents later on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have started operations,\" he replied; \"in a short time you will be\r\n",
      "able to begin your studies, and I hear they will pay you the princely sum\r\n",
      "of ten dollars a month from the day you are accepted. Canadians are\r\n",
      "greatly in demand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ten dollars!\" gasped Priscilla, \"Ten dollars a month! when I think what\r\n",
      "this hundred has done, and the twelve months in each year, it--it dazzles\r\n",
      "me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell gave an uncomfortable laugh. In the light of nearby\r\n",
      "disillusionment his practical joke looked mean and ghastly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, with another abrupt change of thought, Priscilla brought Boswell\r\n",
      "again at bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Before I go into training,\" she said, \"I must go and see Master\r\n",
      "Farwell's friend--his old friend, you know. I feel very guilty and\r\n",
      "ungrateful, but it has all been so strange and bewildering, I have seemed\r\n",
      "dead and done for and then born again, I could not help myself; but I can\r\n",
      "now. Please tell me all about her, Mr. Boswell, and how I can find her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell dropped the pencil upon the mahogany desk and looked blankly at\r\n",
      "Priscilla.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us sit by the fire,\" he said presently, \"I am cold and--tired. Turn\r\n",
      "down the lights.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They took their positions near the hearth: the dwarf in his low, deep\r\n",
      "leather chair with its wide \"wings\" that hid him so mercifully; Priscilla\r\n",
      "in the small rocker that from the first had seemed to meet every curve\r\n",
      "and line of her long, young body with restful welcome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And now,\" Priscilla urged, \"please tell me. I feel, to-night, like\r\n",
      "myself once more. I am adjusted to the new life, I hope, ready to do my\r\n",
      "part.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When John Boswell cast aside his whimsical phase he was a very simple and\r\n",
      "direct man. He, too, was becoming adjusted to Priscilla's presence in his\r\n",
      "home and her rightful demands upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I will tell you,\" he said slowly, wearily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perhaps you are too tired to-night, Mr. Boswell? To-morrow will do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. I never sleep when the wind howls; it gets into my imagination. I'd\r\n",
      "rather talk. The thing I have to tell you--is what I shall tell Farwell\r\n",
      "if I ever see him again. It's rather a bungling thing I've done. I'll\r\n",
      "receive my reward, doubtlessly, but I would do the same, were I placed in\r\n",
      "the same position, over and over again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Farwell Maxwell, known to you as Anton Farwell, has been part, the\r\n",
      "biggest part, of my life since we were young boys. We were about as\r\n",
      "pitiful a contrast as can be imagined, and for that reason met each\r\n",
      "other's needs more completely. We had only one thing in common--money. He\r\n",
      "was a straight, handsome fellow, while I was--what you see before you--a\r\n",
      "crooked, distorted creature, but one in whose heart and soul dwelt all\r\n",
      "the cravings and aspirations of youth and intelligence. I was alone in\r\n",
      "the world. My father died before my birth, and I cost my mother--her\r\n",
      "life. Farwell had, until he was twenty, an adoring though foolish mother,\r\n",
      "who laid undue emphasis upon his rights and privileges. She, and an older\r\n",
      "brother, died when he was twenty-one--died before the trouble came, but\r\n",
      "not before they had done all they could to train him for it. At\r\n",
      "twenty-one he was a selfish, hot-headed fellow with a fortune at his\r\n",
      "command, a confused sense of right and wrong, an ungoverned, artistic\r\n",
      "nature swayed by impulse, and, yes, honest affection and generous\r\n",
      "flashes. And I? Well, I found I could buy with my money what otherwise I\r\n",
      "must have gone without, but the shadow never counted for the substance\r\n",
      "with me. The fawning favour, which held its sneer in check, filled me\r\n",
      "with disgust, and I would have been a bitter, lonely fellow but--for\r\n",
      "Farwell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never could quite understand him; I do not to-day, but he, from the\r\n",
      "beginning, did not seem to recognize or admit my limitations. Through\r\n",
      "preparatory school and college we went side by side. He called me by the\r\n",
      "frank and brutal names that boys and men only use to equals. I wonder if\r\n",
      "you can understand when I say that to hear him address me as an infernal\r\n",
      "coward, when I shrank from certain things, was about the highest\r\n",
      "compliment I knew?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" murmured Priscilla, \"I can understand that.\" She could not see\r\n",
      "Boswell; the low, impassioned words came from out the shadows like\r\n",
      "thoughts. \"Yes, I can quite understand how you felt.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am glad that you can, for then you will see--why I have done--what I\r\n",
      "could for Farwell--when he needed me. Back in those old days he was not\r\n",
      "content to shame me into playing my part; by that power of his, that\r\n",
      "worked both good and evil, he compelled others, in accepting him, to\r\n",
      "accept me on equal terms. There was a seat for me at the tables to which\r\n",
      "he was invited; he discovered my poor talent for telling a story, and\r\n",
      "somehow hypnotized others into considering me a wit! A wit!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A silence fell between the two by the fire. Priscilla's throat was hard\r\n",
      "and dry, her heart aching with pity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then,\" Boswell continued drearily, \"the crash came when he was only\r\n",
      "twenty-five! I suppose he was savagely primitive. That was why externals\r\n",
      "did not count so much with him. He could not brook opposition, especially\r\n",
      "if injustice marked it; he was never able to estimate or eliminate. He\r\n",
      "was like a child when an obstacle presented itself. If he could not get\r\n",
      "around it, he attacked it with blind passion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was part of his nature to espouse the cause of the weak and needy;\r\n",
      "that was what held him, unconsciously, to me; it was what attracted him\r\n",
      "to Joan Moss.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The name fell upon Priscilla's mind like a shock. The story was nearing\r\n",
      "the crisis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She was outwardly beautiful; inwardly she was as deformed--as I! But in\r\n",
      "neither case was he ever able to get the right slant. He loved us both in\r\n",
      "his splendid, uncritical way. His love brought me to his feet in abject\r\n",
      "devotion: it lured the woman to accomplish his destruction. Something,\r\n",
      "some one, menaced her! He tried to sweep the evil aside, but----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, please go on!\" Priscilla was breathless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, he couldn't sweep it aside; so he committed--murder.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! Mr. Boswell!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shuddering cry drew Boswell to the present. He remembered that his\r\n",
      "listener knew Farwell only as a friend and gentle comrade. Her shock was\r\n",
      "natural.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you never guessed? Why do you think he, that brilliant fellow,\r\n",
      "stayed hidden like a dead thing all these years?\"--there was a quiver in\r\n",
      "Boswell's voice--\"hidden so deep that--not even I dared to go to him for\r\n",
      "fear I would be followed and he again trapped! Oh! 'twas an ugly thing he\r\n",
      "did; but he was driven to insanity--even his judges believed that--at the\r\n",
      "last; but his victim was too big a man to go unavenged, so they hunted\r\n",
      "Farwell down, caught him in a trap, and tried to finish him, but he got\r\n",
      "away and they thought him--dead.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" moaned Priscilla, \"yes, I know. And the woman--did her heart\r\n",
      "break?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this Boswell leaned forward, and, in the fire's glow, Priscilla saw\r\n",
      "his face grow cruel and hard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Her heart break? No, she went promptly to the devil, once she was sure\r\n",
      "she had lost Farwell and his money. Down to the last hope she made him\r\n",
      "believe in her. How she acted! But when he was reported dead, well!\"--and\r\n",
      "Boswell gave a harsh laugh--\"her heart did not break!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sound brought Boswell back to the dim room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are--crying?\" he said slowly; \"crying for him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For him, yes, and for you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For me?\"--a wonderful tenderness stole into the man's voice--\"for me? I\r\n",
      "do not think any one before--ever cried for me. Thank you. You understand\r\n",
      "what all this meant to me? What a--woman you will be--if----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla raised her tear-stained face and her lips quivered as she\r\n",
      "recalled that Farwell had said almost exactly the same words to her back\r\n",
      "there in the In-Place. She understood because she had been lonely and\r\n",
      "known the suffering of the lonely. She must never forget, never fail\r\n",
      "those who needed her! But Boswell was talking on again with a new note of\r\n",
      "feeling in his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"While I thought him dead I sank back into my shell, sank lower than I\r\n",
      "had ever been before. I wanted to die; wanted it so truly that I planned\r\n",
      "it; grew interested in arranging my affairs. Preparing to die became my\r\n",
      "excitement, and when everything was ready, Farwell spoke to me--from his\r\n",
      "grave! That letter from your In-Place worked a miracle upon me. While he\r\n",
      "lived there would always be something for me to do. He had made a place\r\n",
      "in the world for me; I could keep his place ready for him. It was a small\r\n",
      "return, but it meant life--for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There were years when Farwell felt he was coming back. I heard from him\r\n",
      "spring and autumn, and there were hope and promise each time. When people\r\n",
      "forgot, he would return, and he wanted to go to--to Joan Moss himself\r\n",
      "with his story. So long as he knew that she was alive and faithful it was\r\n",
      "enough, and, besides, he realized that had she or I gone to him just then\r\n",
      "it might have been fatal. He believed that if she knew where he was she\r\n",
      "would hasten to him!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, just at first I thought that he might come at any time and might\r\n",
      "rescue--Joan Moss. I was even willing for him to have her if it could add\r\n",
      "any happiness to him. Then there was the money--his money. I kept his\r\n",
      "belief in that, too. Everything of his went at the time of the trial, but\r\n",
      "mine was his, so that was a small matter. I suppose all the sentiment and\r\n",
      "passion that most men spread over their entire lives were, in me,\r\n",
      "concentrated on Farwell. When I thought of him caged and alone, in the\r\n",
      "wilds, I found lying to him about the only thing I could do. So I kept\r\n",
      "his belief in Joan Moss and his fortune. Then something happened to him.\r\n",
      "I never knew what it was, but it seemed to take all the hope and courage\r\n",
      "from him. He wanted me to see that Joan Moss was well taken care of, and\r\n",
      "in case of his death she must have all that he died possessed of. Just at\r\n",
      "that time Joan Moss came to me, a wreck! She lived only six months, but\r\n",
      "for his sake I saw that she had all that he would have had for her. She\r\n",
      "thought that he gave it to her, too, or at least she thought his money\r\n",
      "gave it, since it was in his will that she should have it. His name was\r\n",
      "on her lips when the end came. I will tell him that some day. It will\r\n",
      "help him to forgive me. After that I wrote and wrote to him, making\r\n",
      "frantic efforts to secure to him, until he were free, what existed no\r\n",
      "longer on earth! That is all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fire had died down and become ashy; the wind no longer howled; the\r\n",
      "night had fallen into peace at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla got up stiffly, for she was cold and nerve-worn. She walked\r\n",
      "unsteadily to Boswell, her tear-stained face twitching with emotion, her\r\n",
      "hands outstretched. In her eyes was the look that only once or twice\r\n",
      "in his life had Boswell ever seen directed toward him by any human\r\n",
      "being--the look that claimed the hidden and best in him, forgetting the\r\n",
      "deformities that limited him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think you are the best man on earth, the noblest friend. Oh! what can\r\n",
      "we do for Master Farwell?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Quite simply Boswell took the hands in his. Her eyes made him brave and\r\n",
      "strong, and her \"we\" throbbed in his thoughts like a warm and tender\r\n",
      "caress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must leave that to me,\" he said gently, giving his kindly smile. \"I\r\n",
      "cannot share this burden with you. So long have I borne it that it has\r\n",
      "become sacred to me. It means only making the story a little longer, a\r\n",
      "little stronger. Some day he will have to know--some day; but not now!\r\n",
      "not now!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just then a distant church bell struck the midnight hour. Solemnly,\r\n",
      "insistently, the twelve strokes rose and fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The wind has passed,\" whispered Boswell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, and the fire is dead. You are very, very tired, I am sure,\"\r\n",
      "Priscilla murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something new and maternal had entered into her thought and voice. While\r\n",

      "soul who played with sternest problems because he had no other toys with\r\n",
      "which to while away his dreary years; no other offerings for them he\r\n",
      "loved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. The play is over for--to-night. The Property Man can take his rest\r\n",

      "style. I was a bit discouraged, but it seems clear and convincing now.\r\n",
      "That is often the way in my trade of story-maker. We come against a blank\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Boswell's confidence concerning Anton Farwell, Priscilla's relation\r\n",
      "to the man who had befriended her, to life itself, became more vital and\r\n",
      "normal. The superficial conditions were dissipated by the knowledge that\r\n",
      "Boswell, in speaking so frankly to her, considered her a woman, not a\r\n",
      "child, and expected a woman's acceptance of duties and responsibilities.\r\n",
      "Besides this, Boswell himself took on new proportions. His whimsical\r\n",
      "oddities had been, for an hour, set aside. For a time he had permitted\r\n",
      "her to see and know him--the simple, good man he really was. In short,\r\n",
      "Priscilla could no longer play, could no longer make a defence of her\r\n",
      "shyness and ignorance; she realized that she must plunge into the\r\n",
      "whirlpool for which she had left the In-Place and she must do so at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell might fantastically play at being ninety and permit her to lend\r\n",
      "her strength and youth to his use, but she never again could be deceived.\r\n",
      "He was assisting her for Farwell's sake. He liked her, found her\r\n",
      "entertaining, but intuitively she knew that in order to retain his\r\n",
      "respect and confidence she must fulfil her part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a week or so longer he and she went to operas and theatres together\r\n",
      "while final arrangements were being completed for her immediate\r\n",
      "admittance, on trial, to the finest private hospital in the city, to\r\n",
      "which was attached a training school of high repute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla was both right and wrong about Boswell. He did appreciate and\r\n",
      "admire her insistence to begin her career. It was the only course for her\r\n",
      "to take; but he looked forward to the lonely, empty days without her with\r\n",
      "real concern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had, to a certain extent, grown used to the detachment and\r\n",
      "colourlessness of his life since Farwell had left it; but here, quite\r\n",
      "unexpectedly, a young and vital personality had entered in and had given\r\n",
      "him, in a crude, friendly way, to be sure, what his absent friend had\r\n",
      "given--the assurance that his deformity could not exclude him from the\r\n",
      "sweet humanity that was keen enough to recognize the soul of him.\r\n",
      "Sensitive, shrinking from suffering and publicity, the man found in\r\n",
      "Priscilla's companionship and confiding friendliness the deepest joy he\r\n",
      "had known since his great loss. He wished that he was ninety, indeed, and\r\n",
      "that his infirmity and wealth might secure for him this new interest that\r\n",
      "had taken him out of himself and caused his sluggish senses to revive.\r\n",
      "But he was not yet fifty. For all his handicaps he was still in fair\r\n",
      "health, and the best that he could hope for was that Priscilla, among\r\n",
      "her new duties, would remember him, come back to him, make his lonely\r\n",
      "home a retreat and comfort when her arduous duties permitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Those last few days of freedom and companionship were beautiful to them\r\n",
      "both. With pride and a certain complacency, Boswell saw that he had\r\n",
      "somewhat formed and developed Priscilla's tastes and judgment. She was no\r\n",
      "longer the ignorant girl she once had been. Music did not now move her to\r\n",
      "tears and a kind of dumb suffering. She began to understand, to control\r\n",
      "her emotions, and gain, through them, pleasure without pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She laughs,\" Boswell thought, \"more intelligently and discriminately\r\n",
      "when she sees a good farce.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this was satisfying to them, but on a certain late-winter day it came\r\n",
      "to an end, and Priscilla, thrilling with a sense of achievement, entered\r\n",
      "St. Albans on probation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What the weeks of doubt and preparation meant, no one, not even Boswell,\r\n",
      "ever knew. The old childish determination to suffer, in order to know,\r\n",
      "held true and unfaltering. The tortured nerves, after the first shocks,\r\n",
      "regained their poise and strength; the heavy work and strict discipline\r\n",
      "left the sturdy body like fine steel, although weariness often tested it\r\n",
      "sorely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Tis not to dance, Priscilla Glenn,\" she often warned herself; \"it is to\r\n",
      "suffer and know!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she grimly set her strong, white teeth. With all the getting and\r\n",
      "relinquishing, however, she never forgot to laugh, and her courageous\r\n",
      "cheerfulness won for her more than she realized while she was learning\r\n",
      "the curves of her Road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then she was accepted. No one but herself had ever doubted her\r\n",
      "triumph, but when she first learned the verdict she was wild with delight\r\n",
      "and could hardly wait for her \"hours off\" to tell Boswell all about it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was \"capped\" at last. No hard-won crown was ever appreciated more\r\n",
      "than that white trifle which rested like a bit of snow upon the \"rusty\r\n",
      "hair\" of Priscilla Glenn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before the little mirror in her own bedchamber, on that first victorious\r\n",
      "day, she posed and confided to her appreciative reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So this is Priscilla Glenn of the In-Place?\" she whispered. \"I simply\r\n",
      "can't believe it! No one else would believe it either; and you are not\r\n",
      "the same. You never will be again what you once were.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flush of excitement showed plainer now than of yore, for the clear,\r\n",
      "dark skin had taken on the delicacy of the city's tint. The eyes were\r\n",
      "deep and grave, for already they had witnessed the mystery of life and\r\n",
      "death. They had smiled down at pain-racked motherhood; had held, in calm\r\n",
      "courage, many an outgoing soul. Priscilla had a closer vision than she\r\n",
      "once had had when she dreamed her dreams of what lay beyond the Secret\r\n",
      "Portage and the Big Bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reflection nodded acknowledgment to all that the excited brain\r\n",
      "affirmed. Then suddenly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, Priscilla Glenn, you are crying! And for--which?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The quaint expression brought a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are homesick, Priscilla Glenn, homesick for what you have never had!\r\n",
      "That's the matter with you. You want some one to go to and tell about\r\n",
      "this, but in all the world there isn't any one who could understand. You\r\n",
      "poor, poor dear! What would your father and mother think of you? There,\r\n",
      "now, never mind. You are only a--blue and white nurse. Even Master\r\n",
      "Farwell and Mr. Boswell could not understand; but a woman could. Some\r\n",
      "woman! She would know what it means to be free at last and have\r\n",
      "something, quite your own, with which to hew and cut your own road; yes,\r\n",
      "your own road, right along to--to the end, just as old Pine used to cut\r\n",
      "the new trails. It's the standing up straight at last on your own roots\r\n",
      "like the dear little white birch in the Place Beyond the Winds. A woman\r\n",
      "could understand, but no one else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By some subtle power Priscilla had thought and talked her fancy far and\r\n",
      "away from the plain room of St. Albans. Her longing, her quaint \"for\r\n",
      "which?\" the memory of the Indian guide and the little white birch had\r\n",
      "performed a miracle. Through the excitement and elation stole the\r\n",
      "fantastic power of childhood. She was on her Road, bound for her Heart's\r\n",
      "Desire! No doubt, no misgiving, assailed the moment of joy. Forward, just\r\n",
      "a little beyond, success awaited her. The possibility of defeat was over\r\n",
      "forever. From now on, through weariness, toil, and perhaps suffering, she\r\n",
      "was going to her own. She had never realized the tense mental and\r\n",
      "physical strain through which she had passed; she did not realize it now,\r\n",
      "but with the relaxation came an almost dangerous exhilaration. The\r\n",
      "present, only so far as it verified the past, had no hold upon her;\r\n",
      "she let herself go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Back again was she in Kenmore. It was springtime, and the red rocks and\r\n",
      "hemlocks shone and the water sparkled; she heard it lapping against the\r\n",
      "tiny islands, so glad was it to be free of the winter's grasp. Some one\r\n",
      "was dancing to the Spring's Call--a small, graceful thing with a bright\r\n",
      "red cape flying on the wind, the soft wind of the In-Place. There was\r\n",
      "music, too! Oh! how clearly it came rising and falling; and then, in the\r\n",
      "bare hospital room, the blue-clad nurse tripped this way and that, while\r\n",
      "memory held true to note and step!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! It was on again, on again, that dear old dance. It dried the tears in\r\n",
      "the tender eyes and held the smile on the joyous lips. Then, as suddenly\r\n",
      "as it had begun, the dance ceased, a flushed face confronted the\r\n",
      "reflection in the glass, and a low curtsey followed, while a reverent\r\n",
      "voice repeated as if in prayer:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Skib, skib, skibble--de--de--dosh!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The words came of their own volition; they were part and kin to the mood\r\n",
      "that held and swayed her. They were a pagan plea for guidance and\r\n",
      "protection in the opening life where wind and fury would beset her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly words of everyday life found their way to her detached\r\n",
      "consciousness and recalled her to the present with almost cruel force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's the little Canuck he wants! Just fancy! I heard him say so to--to\r\n",
      "Mrs. Thomas. Such injustice! But there the old Grenadier comes now.\r\n",
      "Hustle!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla heard the scampering feet, then, after a moment's pause, the\r\n",
      "dignified advance of the superintendent. There was a tap on the door. The\r\n",
      "doors of some rooms, owing to discipline, were never tapped by Mrs.\r\n",
      "Thomas, but the reason that compelled her to show this courtesy to\r\n",
      "Priscilla also caused her to wish this young Canadian was a less serious\r\n",
      "person; one more prone to frivol in her \"hours off,\" and not have, for\r\n",
      "her most intimate companion, the strange dwarf. She could have forgiven\r\n",
      "Priscilla Glenn if, having overdone her \"late leave,\" she had crawled\r\n",
      "into a back window to escape punishment. It would have made her more\r\n",
      "understandable. As it was, Mrs. Thomas tapped!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come in, please,\" said Priscilla, and the large, handsome superintendent\r\n",
      "entered and sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I would come and tell you,\" she said, trying to keep her\r\n",
      "professional expression while her maternal heart warmed to the girl,\r\n",
      "\"that you have been highly honoured. There is to be a very important\r\n",
      "operation to-morrow at three o'clock. Doctor Ledyard is to perform it,\r\n",
      "assisted by his young partner. He has asked for several nurses, and he\r\n",
      "named _you_--singled you out. He has observed you; wishes to--use you.\r\n",
      "It's a great compliment, Miss Glynn.\" So often had Priscilla corrected,\r\n",
      "to no avail, the wrong pronouncing of her name, that she now accepted it\r\n",
      "without further demur. Flushing and trembling, she went close to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Thomas and held her hands out impulsively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All my glory is coming at once!\" she faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Glory? Well, you are a queer girl. To stand for hours under that man's\r\n",
      "eye! You call it glory? Why, it is an honour because it is _that man,\r\n",
      "that eye_; but as to glory! My dear Miss Glynn, I must insist that you go\r\n",
      "off this afternoon and play--somewhere. Then come back and get a good\r\n",
      "night's rest. The life of the richest man in New York will hang in the\r\n",
      "balance to-morrow, and not even the glorified nurse can afford to have a\r\n",
      "trembling hand when she passes up an instrument or wipes the perspiration\r\n",
      "from the surgeon's brow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, oh! thank you, Mrs. Thomas! Of course, if I were not so\r\n",
      "stupid I could make you understand how I feel. I seem to have found the\r\n",
      "right way, and everything is conspiring to tell me so. You see, I might\r\n",
      "not have qualified; some girls do not. No one might have noticed me; you\r\n",
      "might not have been so kind. Often I am rather lonely and ungrateful;\r\n",
      "but you must try to believe that I am--very happy now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I suppose\"--Mrs. Thomas was holding the radiant young face with her\r\n",
      "clear, calm eyes--\"I suppose you are one of those natures that craves\r\n",
      "success; cannot brook defeat. Life will deal harshly with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am willing to suffer. It is the learning I must have. It is the chance\r\n",
      "to learn that makes me so glad,\" Priscilla burst in, \"and it's this sure\r\n",
      "feeling that I am on the right trail.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is a difference. But somehow the career of a nurse is\r\n",
      "so--well--difficult, and--hard,\" Mrs. Thomas went on. \"I wonder how you\r\n",
      "can approach it with your enthusiasm undaunted after months of service.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not know, but it seems my road to what is mine. It gets me so near\r\n",
      "people--when they most need me--are so glad to have me! There seems to\r\n",
      "be nothing between me--and them. I love it, oh! I love it, Mrs. Thomas!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here, Miss Glynn, where are you going this afternoon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I do not know; just--going.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish--dear me! I do wish you could go somewhere; do something\r\n",
      "shockingly frivolous.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I couldn't to-day. I feel like praying--or dancing. There's the most\r\n",
      "wonderful, singing feeling inside of me. That's why I do not need--fun\r\n",
      "as much as most of the girls do. You are very kind; I think I will go to\r\n",
      "your big, fine park and walk and walk. I'd like to see the sun set and\r\n",
      "the stars----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, Miss Glynn, unless you promise me to get under shelter before the\r\n",
      "stars come out I'll call the police. Some day you will learn that New\r\n",
      "York is not your Canadian hamlet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla laughed gayly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. I will take my walk and then go to my dear old friend. He'll\r\n",
      "be looking for me from his high window. He always stands there late\r\n",
      "afternoons, on the chance of my coming. He says it's a pleasure to feel\r\n",
      "you have something that _may_ come, even if you know it isn't coming just\r\n",
      "then.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla changed her clothing and set forth a half hour later for her\r\n",
      "walk and to meet with an adventure that changed the current of her\r\n",
      "thought materially. From that afternoon she was pressed and forced up her\r\n",
      "Road by a power that had taken her into control with definite purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went into the park at the lower entrance and walked rapidly to a high\r\n",
      "place that was a favourite with her. So peaceful and detached it was that\r\n",
      "she could generally think her thoughts, sing aloud a little song, and\r\n",
      "feel safe from intrusion. Being high and open, the sunlight rested longer\r\n",
      "there than it did below and misled one as to time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a glorious sunset that evening, a golden, deep one, against\r\n",
      "which the bare trees, towers, and house roofs stood outlined black and\r\n",
      "sharp. It was like a burnished shield. It was a still day, with a gentle\r\n",
      "crispness in the air that stimulated while it did not chill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything is waiting. What for? what for?\" Priscilla whispered sociably\r\n",
      "to herself. She was young, full of health and success. Of course she was\r\n",
      "waiting as the young do. And then something touched her cheek softly,\r\n",
      "and, looking down, she saw that her dark suit was covered with feathery\r\n",
      "snowflakes. So silently had they escaped a passing cloud that she was\r\n",
      "startled. She arose at once and was surprised to find, in the hollow\r\n",
      "below, that the paths were crusted and the electric lights gleamed\r\n",
      "yellow through a fluttering mist of flying snow. It was very beautiful,\r\n",
      "but it warned one to hasten, and besides it had grown quite dark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a path, Priscilla knew it well, that led straight across the\r\n",
      "park to an entrance near Boswell's home, and she took it now at a rapid\r\n",
      "pace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The beauty of the walk did not escape her, the exhilaration of the air\r\n",
      "acted like a cordial upon her, she seemed hardly to touch the ground as\r\n",
      "she ran on; and once she paused before setting her foot upon the lovely\r\n",
      "whiteness. As she hesitated some one stepped from the shadow of a clump\r\n",
      "of bushes and confronted her under the electric light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can you tell me how to find the nearest way out? I'm lost.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla's heart gave one hard throb and stood still, it seemed for an\r\n",
      "hour, while an almost forgotten terror seized and held her. She was\r\n",
      "looking full upon Jerry-Jo McAlpin! A soiled and haggard shadow he was\r\n",
      "of what he once had been, but it was Jerry-Jo and no other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I did not mean to frighten you. Forgive me. I ain't going to hurt\r\n",
      "you, Miss. I----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Priscilla was gone before the sentence was finished. Gone before she\r\n",
      "knew whether the speaker had recognized her or not. Gone before--and then\r\n",
      "she stood still. She could not leave him to wander alone at night in that\r\n",
      "big, strange place. No matter what happened, she must treat him humanly,\r\n",
      "she, who knew the danger. She went back, her blood running like ice\r\n",
      "through her body; but Jerry-Jo McAlpin was not there. Priscilla waited,\r\n",
      "and once she spoke vague directions to the empty space, but no answering\r\n",
      "voice replied. Presently she controlled herself, and took to the path\r\n",
      "again, and reached John Boswell's house before he had left his window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She did not tell of the encounter; she felt she must wait, but in her\r\n",
      "heart she knew that Jerry-Jo McAlpin was as surely on her trail as she\r\n",
      "was herself. Such things as that meeting did not happen to them of the\r\n",
      "In-Place unless for a purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had a wonderful evening with Boswell. They did not go out, and after\r\n",
      "dinner he read her some manuscript stories. Boswell had never before so\r\n",
      "intimately permitted her to come close to his work. She had seen stories\r\n",
      "of his in print, had heard plans for others, but before the fire in his\r\n",
      "study that night he read, among other things, \"The Butterfly and the\r\n",
      "Beetle.\" So beautifully, so touchingly, had he pictured the little\r\n",

      "lonely man; that she came to him naturally and eagerly, during her hours\r\n",

      "subjects to escape his control. It was the half-playful, but wholly\r\n",
      "kind dignity that had won for him Priscilla's faith and dependence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a week or two after Gordon Moffatt's operation things went calmly and\r\n",
      "prosaically at the hospital. The rich man recovered so rapidly and\r\n",
      "satisfactorily that even the outside world took things for granted, and\r\n",
      "any items of news concerning him were to be found on the inside pages of\r\n",
      "the newspapers. During his convalescence Priscilla met Doctor Ledyard and\r\n",
      "Doctor Travers many times. Once, by some mysterious arrangement, she was\r\n",
      "assigned charge, in the rich man's room, while his own nurse was absent.\r\n",
      "For three days and nights she obeyed his impatient commands and reasoned\r\n",
      "with him when he confused his dependent condition with his usual\r\n",
      "domineering position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn me!\" he once complained to Travers when he thought Priscilla was\r\n",
      "out of hearing; \"that young woman you've given charge over me ought to\r\n",
      "have a bigger field for her accomplishments. She's a natural-born tyrant.\r\n",
      "I tried to escape her this morning; had got as far as one foot out of bed\r\n",
      "when she bore down upon me, calmly, devilishly calmly, pointed to my\r\n",
      "offending foot, and said: \"Back, sir!\" Then we argued a bit--I'm afraid I\r\n",
      "was a trifle testy--and finally she laid hands upon my ankle in the most\r\n",
      "scientific manner and had me on my back before I could think of the\r\n",
      "proper adjectives to apply to her impudence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers laughed and looked beyond the sick man's bed to the bowed head of\r\n",
      "Priscilla as she bent over some preparation she was compounding in an\r\n",
      "anteroom. From a high window the sunlight was streaming down on the\r\n",
      "wonderful rusty-coloured hair. The girl's attitude of detachment and\r\n",
      "concentration held the physician's approving glance, but the wave of\r\n",
      "hair under the white cap and against the smooth, clear skin lingered in\r\n",
      "the memory of the _man_ long after he forgot Moffatt's amusing anecdote.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then, because things were closing in upon Priscilla Glenn's little\r\n",
      "stage, something happened so commonplace in its character that its effect\r\n",
      "upon the girl was out of all proportion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a rather strenuous day she was sleeping heavily in her little white\r\n",
      "room when a sharp knock on her door brought her well-trained senses into\r\n",
      "action at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's been an accident, Miss Glynn.\" It was the superintendent who\r\n",
      "spoke. \"Please report on Ward Five as soon as possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an insignificant accident; such a one as occurs shockingly often\r\n",
      "in our big cities. A large touring car, with seven passengers, rushing up\r\n",
      "a broad avenue with a conscientious man at the wheel, had overhauled a\r\n",
      "poor derelict with apparently no fixed purpose in his befuddled brain. In\r\n",
      "order to spare the fellow, the chauffeur had wheeled his car madly to one\r\n",
      "side, and, by so doing, had hit an electric-light pole, with the result\r\n",
      "that every one was more or less injured, the forlorn creature who had\r\n",
      "caused the excitement, most of all, for the over-turned machine had\r\n",
      "included him in its crushing destruction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four men and three women were carried to St. Albans and now occupied\r\n",
      "private rooms, while the torn and broken body of the unknown stranger lay\r\n",
      "in Ward Five, quite unconscious. He was breathing faintly, and, since\r\n",
      "they had made him clean and decent, he looked very young and wan as he\r\n",
      "rested upon the narrow, white bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla stood at the foot of the cot and read the chart which a former\r\n",
      "nurse had hurriedly made out; then she came around to the side and looked\r\n",
      "down upon--Jerry-Jo McAlpin!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She knew him at once. The deathlike repose had wiped away much that\r\n",
      "recent years had engraven on his face. He looked as Priscilla remembered\r\n",
      "him, standing in his father's boat, proudly playing the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment the quiet girl grew rigid with superstitious fear. That\r\n",
      "deathlike creature before her filled her with unreasoning alarm. She\r\n",
      "almost expected him to open his black eyes and laughingly announce that\r\n",
      "he had found her at last! She longed to flee from the room before he had\r\n",
      "a chance to gain control of her. She breathed fast and hard, as she had\r\n",
      "that morning when his ringing jeer had stayed her feet as she ran from\r\n",
      "the Far Hill Place after the night of terror. Then sanity came to her\r\n",
      "relief and she knew, with a pitying certainty born of her training, that\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo McAlpin could never harm her again. That he was a link between\r\n",
      "the past and the future she realized with strange sureness. He had always\r\n",
      "been that. He had made things happen; been the factor in bringing\r\n",
      "experiences to her. She, in self-preservation, would not claim any\r\n",
      "knowledge of him now; she would care for him and wait--wait until she\r\n",
      "understood just what part he was to play in her present experience.\r\n",
      "He might threaten all that she had gained for herself--her peace and\r\n",
      "security. Her only safeguard now was to ignore the personality before\r\n",
      "her and respond to the appeal of the \"case.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jerry-Jo was destined to become interesting before he slipped away. Known\r\n",
      "only as a number, since he had not been identified or claimed, he rapidly\r\n",
      "rose to importance. After three days of unconsciousness he still\r\n",
      "persisted, and while his soul wandered on the horizon, his body responded\r\n",
      "to the care given it and grew in strength. One doctor after another\r\n",
      "watched and commented on his chances, and in due time Doctor Travers,\r\n",
      "hearing of the case, stopped to examine it, and, in the interest of\r\n",
      "science, suggested an operation that might possibly return the poor\r\n",
      "fellow to a world that had evidently no place for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's worth trying,\" Travers said as he and Priscilla stood beside the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The deep, friendly eyes were fixed upon the girl. She coloured sharply,\r\n",
      "then went quite pale. There was a most unaccountable struggle, and\r\n",
      "Travers smiled as he thought how conscientious she was to feel any deep\r\n",
      "responsibility in a question he had asked, more in idle desire to make\r\n",
      "talk than for any other reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the far place where he had fared for days his mind, lighted by reason,\r\n",
      "was abnormally clear and almost painfully reinforced by memory. Then he\r\n",

      "from the white, fang-like teeth. Before the sound was finished the light\r\n",

      "a fragrance of flowers and the note of birds. Priscilla, in her plain\r\n",
      "white linen dress, was sitting on the broad window seat, and Boswell,\r\n",
      "from his winged chair, looked at her with a tightening of the throat.\r\n",
      "There were times when she made him feel as he felt when Farwell Maxwell\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, Mr. Boswell, don't press me too close! I was a sad innocent when\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The box was uncovered. Some sympathetic hand, as fine as a woman's, had\r\n",
      "bared the secret for her. No mother could possibly have thought out\r\n",
      "detail and perfection more minutely. There it lay, the gift of a generous\r\n",
      "man to a lonely girl, everything for her graduating night! The filmy gown\r\n",
      "with its touch of colour in embroidered thistle flowers; the slippers and\r\n",
      "gloves; even the lace scarf, cloud-like and alluring; the long gloves and\r\n",
      "silken hose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down beside the couch Priscilla knelt and pressed her head against the\r\n",
      "sacred gift. She did not cry nor laugh, but the rapt look that used to\r\n",
      "mark her hours before the shrine in Kenmore grew and grew upon her face.\r\n",

      "\"You will accept? You think I did well in my--shopping?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell stood in the doorway, just where a long path of late June\r\n",
      "sunlight struck across the room. For the girl, looking mutely at him with\r\n",
      "shining eyes, he was transfigured, translated. Only the great, tender\r\n",
      "soul was visible to her; the unasking, the kind spirit. Moved by a sudden\r\n",
      "impulse, Priscilla rose to her feet and walked to him with outstretched\r\n",
      "hands; when she reached him he took her hands in his and smiled up at\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I accept,\" she whispered with a break in her voice. \"You have made\r\n",

      "there will be only you dancing. Yes, I will come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Boswell went. The exercises were held in the little chapel. From his\r\n",
      "far corner he watched the young women, in uniforms of spotless white,\r\n",
      "file to the platform for their diplomas. They all merged, for him, into\r\n",
      "one--a tall, lithe creature with burnished hair, coppery and fine, and an\r\n",
      "exalted face. Later, from behind the mass of palms and ferns in the\r\n",
      "dancing hall, he saw only one girl--a girl in white with the tints of\r\n",
      "the thistle flower matching the deep eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Priscilla danced. Some one, a young doctor, asked her, and\r\n",
      "fortunately for him he was a master hand at following. After a moment of\r\n",
      "surprise, tinged with excited determination, he found himself, with his\r\n",
      "brilliant partner, the centre of attraction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look! oh, do look at the little Canuck!\" cried a classmate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I never saw any one dance as she does\"--it was Doctor Travers who spoke\r\n",
      "from the doorway beside Mrs. Thomas--\"but once before. It's quite\r\n",
      "primeval, an instinct. No one can teach or acquire such grace as that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, suddenly, and apropos of nothing, apparently:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By the way, Mrs. Thomas, Miss Moffatt has been ordered abroad by Doctor\r\n",
      "Ledyard. He spoke to-day about securing a companion-nurse for her. She's\r\n",
      "not really ill, but in rather a curious nervous condition. I was\r\n",
      "wondering if----\" His eyes followed Priscilla, who was nearing the\r\n",
      "cluster of palms behind which Boswell sat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course!\" Mrs. Thomas smiled broadly; \"Miss Glynn, of course! She's\r\n",
      "made to order. The girl has her way to make. She's been rather overdoing\r\n",
      "lately. I don't like the look in her eyes at times. She never asks for\r\n",
      "sympathy or consideration, you understand, but she makes every woman, and\r\n",
      "man, too, judging by that rich cripple, Mr. Boswell, yearn over her.\r\n",
      "She'd be the merriest soul on earth, with half a chance, and she's the\r\n",
      "most capable girl I have: ready for an emergency; never weary. Why, of\r\n",
      "course, Miss Glynn!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll speak to Doctor Ledyard to-night,\" said Travers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, strangely enough, Travers realized that he was very tired. He\r\n",
      "excused himself, and, walking back through the dim city streets to the\r\n",
      "Ledyard home, he thought of Kenmore and the old lodge as he had not for\r\n",
      "years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I believe I'll run up there this summer,\" he muttered half aloud. \"I'll\r\n",
      "take mother and urge Doctor Ledyard to join us. I would like to see how\r\n",
      "far I've travelled from the In-Place in--why it's years and years! All\r\n",
      "the way from boyhood to manhood.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Ledyard changed the current of his desire. The older man was sitting\r\n",
      "in his library when Travers entered, and Helen Travers was in the deep\r\n",
      "window opening to the little garden space behind the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Time had dealt so gently with Helen that now, in her thin white gown, she\r\n",
      "looked even younger than in the Kenmore days, when her dress had been\r\n",
      "more severe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're late,\" said Ledyard, looking keenly at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very late,\" echoed Helen, smiling. \"I had dinner here and am waiting to\r\n",
      "be escorted home.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's refused my company. Where have you been, Dick?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I had to give out the diplomas, you know, at St. Albans.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's after eleven now, Dickie.\" Helen's gaze was full of gentle pride.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I stopped for an hour to see those little girls play.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The nurses?\" Ledyard frowned. \"Girls and nurses are not one and the same\r\n",
      "thing, to a doctor.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, come, come, dear friend!\" Helen Travers went close to the two who\r\n",
      "were dearest to her in the world. \"Do not be unmerciful. Being a woman,\r\n",
      "I must stand up for my sex. Did they play prettily, Dick? I'm sure they\r\n",
      "did not look as dear as they do in their uniforms.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One did. She was--well, to put it concisely, she was a--dance!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Umph! That ruddy-headed one, I bet!\" Ledyard turned on another electric\r\n",
      "light. \"See here, Dick, do you think that girl could go abroad with\r\n",
      "Gordon Moffatt's daughter? Moffatt spoke about her. She rather impressed\r\n",
      "him while he was in St. Albans. She stood up against him. He never\r\n",
      "forgets that sort; he swears at it, but he trusts it. The old housekeeper\r\n",
      "is going along to keep the party in order, but a trained hand ought to\r\n",
      "go, too. The Moffatt girl has the new microbe--Unrest. It's playing the\r\n",
      "devil with her nerves. She's got to be jogged into shape.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think we could prevail upon Miss Glynn to go. She has her way to make.\r\n",

      "too minutely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Rather what, Dick?\" Helen had her head against her boy's shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hunting a job,\" he lied manfully. \"Most of those girls are up against it\r\n",
      "once the training is over.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And Dick,\" Helen raised her eyes, \"Doctor Ledyard and I were talking\r\n",
      "of a trip abroad this summer for--ourselves. Will you come? We want the\r\n",
      "off-the-track places. Little by-products, you know. I'm hungry for--well,\r\n",
      "for detachment; but with those I love.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just the thing, little mother, just the thing!\" The In-Place faded from\r\n",
      "sight. In its stead rose a lonely mountain peak that caught the first\r\n",
      "touch of day and held it longest. A little lake lay at its foot, and\r\n",
      "there was the old house where he and Helen had spent so much of the\r\n",
      "summer while he and she were abroad!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it. Her ideas at present are typical of her condition. 'Snip\r\n",

      "then I'll come back and be good!' The girl's a fool, but most girls are\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"You promised--Pine?\"\r\n",

      "given to him--really? The smiles and jokes of the days long ago that were\r\n",
      "heavenly to him--what did they cost you? He gave, and gave his heart's\r\n",
      "best; he lied and cheated you, that you might have--some sort of peace\r\n",

      "not connect the men with her past, or had reasons for not referring to\r\n",

      "tamper with us here. Dear old Mousey never gets above a dead level, or\r\n",
      "below it. Practically we are alone and detached. Let us play--girls!\r\n",
      "Nice, chummy girls. Do you know, I never had a friend in my life who\r\n",
      "wasn't labelled and scheduled? I was sent to school where just such and\r\n",
      "such girls were sent--girls proper for me to know. Often they were not,\r\n",
      "but that was not considered so long as they wore their labels. It wasn't\r\n",
      "deemed necessary for me, or my kind, to go to college: our lines of\r\n",
      "action were chosen for us. Certain labelled men were presented; always\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "nice little girls like me! After a time I got to believe that, and it was\r\n",
      "only when, one day, I touched something not intended for me that my soul\r\n",
      "woke up. Priscilla, did you ever feel your soul?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; the thing you want to be; the thing that seems best to _you_\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And that was the day that Priscilla caught a new light on Margaret's\r\n",
      "character. They landed at a tiny village across the lake and wandered\r\n",
      "about, Margaret talking easily to the people in their own tongue,\r\n",
      "Priscilla straining to follow by watching faces and gestures. While they\r\n",
      "stood so, discussing the price of some corals, a little child came close\r\n",
      "to them and slipped a deliciously dimpled, but very dirty little hand in\r\n",
      "Margaret's. At the touch the girl started, turned first crimson and then\r\n",
      "pale, and looked down. Suddenly her eyes deepened and glowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The darling!\" she whispered, and bent to catch what the child was\r\n",
      "saying. Presently she looked up, tears dimming her eyes, and said to\r\n",
      "Priscilla, \"She says a new baby came to their house last night. She\r\n",
      "wanted to tell--me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And ten already have been there,\" broke in a brown-faced native woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But she is glad, and she wanted _me_ to know! Come, my sweet, tell me\r\n",
      "more about the baby, and then we will go and see it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sat down under a clump of trees, and the dirty little maid nestled\r\n",
      "close to Margaret, while with uplifted head and unabashed confidence she\r\n",
      "told of the mystery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla watched Margaret Moffatt's face. She was almost awed by the\r\n",
      "change that had come over it. The aloofness and pride which often marked\r\n",
      "it had disappeared as if by magic; the tenderness, passionate in its\r\n",
      "intentness, cast upon the little child, moved her to wonder and\r\n",
      "admiration. Later they went to the poor hovel and bent beside the humble\r\n",
      "bed on which the mother and child lay. Then it was that Priscilla played\r\n",
      "her part and made comfortable and grateful the overburdened creature,\r\n",
      "worn and weak from suffering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Twas the good God who sent you,\" murmured she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Twas your little maid,\" smiled Margaret, tucking a roll of bills under\r\n",
      "the hard, lumpy pillow. \"Take time to love the babies--leave other\r\n",
      "things--but love them and enjoy them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, my lady.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the way back in the boat Margaret was very silent for a time as she\r\n",
      "watched Priscilla row; finally she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Did it surprise you--my show of feeling for the--the child?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It was very beautiful. I did not know you cared so much for children,\r\n",
      "and this one was so--dirty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But so real! You see I have never had real children in my life. The\r\n",
      "kinds passed out to nice girls like me were sad travesties. Since I saw\r\n",
      "the darling of to-day I've been wondering--do not laugh, Priscilla--but\r\n",
      "I've been wondering what poor, cheated little morsel of humanity, in the\r\n",
      "unreal world, would find herself in that eleventh miracle of the wretched\r\n",
      "hovel? And what an art yours is, dear Priscilla! How you soothed away the\r\n",
      "suffering by your touch. I loved you better as I realized how that\r\n",
      "training of yours knows neither high nor low when it seeks to heal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla thought of the operation on Margaret Moffatt's father, and her\r\n",
      "quick colour rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I loved you better when I saw how your humanity knows neither high\r\n",
      "nor low--just love!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only toward little children. I cannot explain it, but when I touch the\r\n",
      "babies, their littleness and helplessness make me weak and trembling\r\n",
      "before--well, before the strength comes in a mighty wave. There is a\r\n",
      "physical sensation, a thrill, that comes with the first contact, and when\r\n",
      "they trust me, as that darling did this morning, I feel as if--God had\r\n",
      "singled me out! Only lately have I begun to understand what this means\r\n",
      "in me. It is one reason why I came away. I had to think it out. I\r\n",
      "suppose\"--she paused and looked steadily at Priscilla--\"I suppose the\r\n",
      "maternal has always been a master passion in me, and I've rebelled at\r\n",
      "being an only child; at having no children but the--specialized kind.\r\n",
      "I have been hungry for so many things I am realizing now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In my training I have seen--what you mean. All sorts drift in--to pay\r\n",
      "the price of love or the penalty of passion, as Doctor Ledyard used to\r\n",
      "express it; but\"--and Priscilla's eyes grew darker--\"I used to find--a\r\n",
      "nurse gets so much closer, you know, than a doctor can--I found that\r\n",
      "sometimes it was the penalty of love and the price of passion. Those\r\n",
      "sad young creatures, with only blind instinct to uphold them, were\r\n",
      "so--divinely human, and paid so superbly. When it comes to the hour of\r\n",
      "a life for a life, one thing alone matters, I am afraid, and it is the\r\n",
      "thing _you_ mean, Margaret.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. And what a horrible puzzle it all is. The thing I mean should be\r\n",
      "always there--always. The world's wrong when it is not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly Priscilla, sending the light boat forward by the impulse of her\r\n",
      "last stroke, said, as if it were quite in line with all that had gone\r\n",
      "before:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's Doctor Travers on the wharf!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard her, and called back:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite unintentionally, I assure you. I was waiting for the boat to take\r\n",
      "me across. I've been wandering about, sleeping where I could. I simply\r\n",
      "find myself--here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this both girls laughed merrily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is the place of Found Personalities,\" Margaret Moffatt said,\r\n",
      "jumping lightly to the wharf. \"Perhaps you'll come to the inn and have\r\n",
      "luncheon with us--that is, if you are sure Doctor Ledyard did not send\r\n",
      "you here to spy on me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I haven't seen him since I left America. My mother is with me; she's in\r\n",
      "a crack of the hills in Italy. She wanted to be alone. Doctor Ledyard\r\n",
      "will join us later.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then come to the house. They serve meals on a dangerously poised balcony\r\n",
      "over the lake; we curb our appetites for fear our weight may be the one\r\n",
      "thing the structure cannot stand. Our old housekeeper waits upon us, but\r\n",
      "is in no wise responsible for the food which is often very bad and\r\n",
      "lacking in nourishment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You seem to thrive on it.\" Travers looked at the two before him. \"I\r\n",
      "wonder just what it is this air and place have done to you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell him, Priscilla.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, like you, Doctor Travers, we simply found ourselves--here! That's\r\n",
      "all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers did not leave the inn that night, nor for many days thereafter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doctor Ledyard will join my mother and me early in August,\" he\r\n",
      "explained; \"until then I'm a floating proposition. I wish you'd let me\r\n",
      "stay on a while, Miss Moffatt, right here. I want to analyze the food, it\r\n",
      "puzzles me. Why just this kind of conglomeration should achieve such\r\n",
      "results is interesting. I've gained five pounds in six days.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And lost ten years,\" Margaret broke in. \"I never thought of you as\r\n",
      "young, Doctor Travers; professional men never do seem youthful; but\r\n",
      "_here_ you're rather a good sort.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Travers remained, much to the delight of the old housekeeper, who,\r\n",
      "with a nurse and a doctor in command, cast all responsibility aside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Young Miss looks well,\" she confided to the proprietor's wife, who,\r\n",
      "fortunately, could understand a word or so of English; \"but folks is like\r\n",
      "weather: the fairer they seem, the nearer a storm. When a day or a person\r\n",
      "looks uncommonly fair--a weather breeder, says I, and generally, nine\r\n",
      "times out of ten, I'm right. My young lady is too changed to be\r\n",
      "comfortable. It's either a breaking up, or----\" But here a shout for\r\n",
      "\"Mousey,\" silenced further prophecy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The days ran along without cloud or shadow. Quite naturally, perhaps,\r\n",
      "Priscilla began to think that a drama of life was being enacted in the\r\n",
      "quiet, detached village. They three were always together, always enjoying\r\n",
      "the same things, but certainly no man, so she thought, could be with\r\n",
      "Margaret Moffatt long without falling at her feet. Gradually to Priscilla\r\n",
      "Glenn this girl stood for all that was fine and perfect. In her she saw\r\n",
      "all women as women should be. With the adoration she was so ready to give\r\n",
      "to that which appealed to her, Priscilla lavished the wealth of her\r\n",
      "affection upon Margaret Moffatt. Surely it was because of Margaret that\r\n",
      "Doctor Travers stayed on, and became the life of the party. To be sure he\r\n",
      "was tact itself in making Priscilla feel at ease; but that only confirmed\r\n",
      "her in her belief that he wanted to please Margaret to the uttermost.\r\n",
      "Often Priscilla recalled, with keener appreciation, John Boswell's\r\n",
      "description of Anton Farwell's conception of friendship. In like manner\r\n",
      "Margaret Moffatt claimed for her companion all that justly belonged to\r\n",
      "herself. Dispassionately, vicariously, Priscilla learned to know and\r\n",
      "admire the man who undoubtedly in time would win her one friend. It was\r\n",
      "all beautiful and natural, and in the lovely detachment it grew and grew.\r\n",
      "The long walks and drives, the rows upon the lake by sunlight and\r\n",
      "moonlight, all conspired to perfect the comradeship. They read together,\r\n",
      "sang together--very poorly to be sure--and once, just to vary the charm,\r\n",
      "they travelled to a nearby town and danced at a village fete. An odd\r\n",
      "thing happened there. Owing to high spirits and a sense of\r\n",
      "unconventionality, they entered into the sports with abandon. Travers\r\n",
      "even begged a reel with a pretty Swiss maiden, and led her proudly away,\r\n",
      "much to Margaret's and Priscilla's delight. Later, the men and women of\r\n",
      "the place came forward, and, entering a little ring formed by admiring\r\n",
      "friends, performed, separately, the native dances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers watched Priscilla with a puzzled look in his eyes. She trembled\r\n",
      "with excitement; seemed hypnotized by the exhibition, much of which was\r\n",
      "delightfully graceful and picturesque. Then, suddenly, to the surprise of\r\n",
      "every one, she took advantage of a moment's pause and ran into the ring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Whatever possesses her?\" whispered Margaret to Travers; \"she looks\r\n",
      "bewitched. See! she is--dancing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers watched the tall, slim figure in the thin white gown over\r\n",
      "which a light scarf, of transparent crimson, floated as the evening\r\n",
      "breeze and the girl's motions freed it. At first Priscilla took her steps\r\n",
      "falteringly, her head bent as if trying to recall the measure and rhythm;\r\n",
      "then with more confidence she swung into the lovely pose and action. With\r\n",
      "uplifted eyes and smiling lips, seeming to see something hidden from\r\n",
      "others, she bent and glided, curtesied and tripped, this way and that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lookers-on were wild with delight. The beauty of the thing itself,\r\n",
      "the willingness of the foreigners to join in the sport, aroused the\r\n",
      "temperamental enthusiasm, and the clapping and cheering filled the hall\r\n",
      "with noise. Suddenly the musicians dropped their instruments. They were\r\n",
      "but human, and, since they could not keep in time with this new and\r\n",
      "amazing dance, they drew near to admire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Play!\" pleaded Priscilla, past heeding the sensation she was creating.\r\n",
      "\"The best is yet to come!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Carried out of himself, entering now wholly into the adventure, Travers\r\n",
      "caught up a violin near him and sent the bow over the strings with a\r\n",
      "master touch. He hardly knew what he played; he was himself, carried away\r\n",
      "on a wave of enchantment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The word escaped Priscilla like a cry of glad response.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They two, the musician and the dancer, seemed alone in the open space.\r\n",
      "The flashing eyes, the cheering voices, the clapping hands, even Margaret\r\n",
      "Moffatt, pale, puzzled, yet charmed, were obliterated. It was spring time\r\n",
      "in the Place Beyond the Winds, and the dance of adoration was in full\r\n",
      "swing, while the old tune, never out of time with the graceful, whirling\r\n",
      "form, played on and on. And then--the ring melted away, the lights grew\r\n",

      "splendid elements of primitive justice had been set in motion, and almost\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "life, with all that that means, and for months the emotions and cravings,\r\n",
      "that generally go to the years of making a child and boy, had been\r\n",
      "crowding and pushing me to a sense of having been defrauded, and I meant\r\n",
      "to have my turn at last: my joy and pleasure. It seemed just and right to\r\n",
      "me that I should taste and revel in all that I had been deprived of. I\r\n",
      "had even been deprived of the longing, had not even had the glory of\r\n",
      "conquest. I had been such a meaningless creature, I thought I could\r\n",
      "afford even to be selfish. I shrank from being _different_--I had been\r\n",
      "forced to in the past--but I meant to make up for lost time and take my\r\n",

      "come to me before I realized that life meant one thing, and one thing\r\n",
      "only: the biggest fight or the meanest defeat! I knew that every passion\r\n",
      "that burned and flayed me was a warhorse that, if controlled, would carry\r\n",
      "me safely through the battle; if succumbed to, would trample me under its\r\n",
      "relentless feet. This I knew with my brain, while tradition, inclination,\r\n",
      "and longing called me--fool! Well, I was given strength to follow my\r\n",
      "head; but every year has been a struggle. I found that to be different\r\n",
      "meant contempt often, misunderstanding always. Sometimes it has not\r\n",
      "seemed worth while; the victories were so lonely and useless; but I\r\n",
      "thanked God last night, when I saw your face as you danced, that I could\r\n",
      "offer you a love that need not make the pitiful plea for mercy from your\r\n",

      "along the awful slope! She held to a nearby bush but uprooted it by the\r\n",

      "is over and we return to--to school. I shall be glad and ready to do all\r\n",
      "this a little later on; proud to have you do it for me, and--we'll face\r\n",
      "the music. It is going to be music, dear, I am sure of that. But some\r\n",
      "very stern questions will be asked by that sweet mother of yours, and she\r\n",
      "shall have her answer. Then Doctor Ledyard, with all the prayer gone from\r\n",
      "his eyes, will call me up for judgment and demand to know what right a\r\n",
      "nurse, even a white nurse, had to lay hands upon a young physician who\r\n",

      "But at that moment Margaret Moffatt came upon the scene. The miracle of\r\n",
      "love had transfigured the girl. She looked, as Travers had said to\r\n",
      "Priscilla, like the All Woman: large, fine, and noble, with unashamed\r\n",
      "surrender in her splendid eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Young devotee, could you, would you, give your--love up for her?\"\r\n",

      "\"I could not give my love up for--that is--I, myself; just as the dance\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Folks,\" she said, \"let us keep our nice little surprises to ourselves\r\n",

      "Doctor Richard Travers, you are wanted by your lady mother. Here's a\r\n",
      "telegram. The girl in the office always tells what is in a telegram, to\r\n",
      "spare shock. And Cilla, my shining-headed chum, you and I are going to\r\n",
      "scamper about a bit before we go home. I'd be a miserable defaulter,\r\n",
      "indeed, if I did not give you your share of this experience. Oh! I know\r\n",

      "sacred to her that no personal demands could ever cause her to raise\r\n",
      "objections. Once she was sure that they she worshipped wanted anything\r\n",

      "patience. Mr. Huntter is as fine a man, as upright a one, as I know, his\r\n",
      "ideals and--and present life are above reproach. He is paying a bitter\r\n",
      "debt for youthful and ignorant folly. I believed this impossible, but so\r\n",
      "it is. I am thankful to say, however, that he has every reason to hope\r\n",
      "that the future, after this, is secure. I have chosen you to care for\r\n",

      "down upon the couch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Doctor Hapgood she was a machine merely; an easy-running one, a\r\n",
      "dependable one, but none the less a machine. To Huntter, shut away from\r\n",
      "society, gregarious, friendly, and kindly, she had meant much more. Her\r\n",

      "fine about him, but he was a type that had never entered her life before,\r\n",
      "and often, by his kindliest word and gesture, drew her attention to a\r\n",
      "yawning space between them. She was at her ease, perfectly so, when near\r\n",
      "him, but she knew it was because of the distance that separated them.\r\n",
      "Still, she was confronted by a certain grim fact, and that ugly knowledge\r\n",
      "held him and her together. By some strange process of reason she wanted\r\n",
      "him to live up to the best in him. There were two markedly different\r\n",
      "sides of his nature; she trembled before one; before the other she gave\r\n",
      "homage as she did to Travers, to John Boswell, and Master Farwell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The day before, Huntter had had a long talk with Doctor Hapgood while she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then Priscilla, losing consciousness gradually, thought of Travers, of\r\n",
      "Margaret Moffatt, who believed her to be out of the city. She smiled\r\n",
      "happily as she relived her blessed memories of good men and women. They\r\n",
      "justified and sanctified life, love, and happiness, and they made it\r\n",
      "possible for her, poor, struggling, little white nurse as she was, with\r\n",
      "all her professional knowledge, to trust and sympathize, and faithfully\r\n",
      "serve.\r\n",

      "A groan brought Priscilla to her feet, alert and quivering. Like a sudden\r\n",

      "nightmare that haunts my chamber after you go, I have to play sleep even\r\n",
      "if I'm dying with thirst or blue devils? She's religious! Think of a\r\n",

      "I'm going to get up to-day, Miss Glynn. I've bullied Hapgood into giving\r\n",

      "I'm back from Bermuda, you know. After you've fixed me up--isn't it a\r\n",
      "glorious day?--open the windows, and--I've ordered a lot of flowers.\r\n",
      "Put them in those brass bowls. My visitor is a lady. She likes yellow\r\n",
      "roses. By the way, Miss Glynn, Doctor Hapgood tells me that you've been\r\n",
      "in--Bermuda, too? Thorough old disciplinarian he! You must have been\r\n",
      "lonely. And you leave me next week? I want to thank you. I shall thank\r\n",
      "you ceremoniously every time you enter after this. You've been--a good\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Huntter. And you've been--a very brave man! I know you will\r\n",

      "distort life! I must have been a sad trial to you, but I'm myself again.\r\n",
      "Tell me, honest true, Miss Glynn, just how have I come out in your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"My beloved!\" she whispered. \"Oh! my dear, my dear! How ill you have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Alone in the anteroom, the hideous truth flayed Priscilla into suffering\r\n",
      "and clear vision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What shall I do?\" she moaned, clasping her hands and swaying back and\r\n",
      "forth. All the burden and responsibility of the world seemed cast upon\r\n",

      "to face her friend! How could she, when she remembered that holy night of\r\n",
      "confession in the little Swiss village? Again she moaned, \"Oh! my God!\"\r\n",
      "But she was spared that scene. Moments, though they seemed ages, passed,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Miss Glynn!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She hardly recognized his voice. It was--triumphant, thrilling. It rang\r\n",
      "boldly, commandingly. When she entered, Huntter was alone. Gone was the\r\n",
      "guest; gone the mass of golden roses. Huntter turned a face glowing and\r\n",
      "confident to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just because you are you, Miss Glynn, and because I'm the happiest man\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The week of recuperation Doctor Hapgood recommended was one of prolonged\r\n",
      "torture to Priscilla Glenn. Thinking of it afterward, she realized that\r\n",
      "it was the Gethsemane of her life--the hour when, forsaken by all, she\r\n",
      "fought her bitter fight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The drift of the ages confronted her. Her own insignificance, her\r\n",
      "humbleness, accentuated and betrayed her. Who would listen? How dared she\r\n",
      "speak! Who would heed her?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One, and one only. Margaret Moffatt!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From her Priscilla shrank and hid until she could gain courage to go\r\n",
      "and--by saving her, kill her! Yes, it meant that. The killing of the\r\n",
      "beautiful All Woman, as Travers had called her. After the telling there\r\n",
      "would be only the shadow of the splendid creature that God had meant to\r\n",
      "be so happy, if only the wrong of the world had not come between!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were moments when, worn by struggle and wakeful nights, Priscilla\r\n",
      "felt incapable of sane thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why should she interfere, she asked herself. Professional silence was her\r\n",
      "only course. And--there was the chance--the chance! Against it stood,\r\n",
      "pleading, Margaret's radiant love and Huntter's strength and devotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who could blame her if she--forgot? But oh! how they would curse her if\r\n",
      "she spoke! They might not believe; they might ruin her!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then faith laid its commanding touch upon her spirit. It had been given\r\n",
      "her to know a woman who, for high principles and all the sacred future,\r\n",
      "was prepared to sacrifice her love if needs must be!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They two, Margaret of the high-soul, and she, Priscilla Glenn of the\r\n",
      "understanding devotion, seemed to stand apart and alone, each, in her\r\n",
      "way, called upon to testify and act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It must be done!\" moaned Priscilla; \"she must know and--decide! But how?\r\n",
      "how?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Boswell and Master Farwell were gone to the In-Place. The sanctuary\r\n",
      "overlooking the river was closed. There was no one, no place, to which\r\n",

      "left her no peace or rest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had taken a tiny suite in a family hotel. The rooms had the comfort\r\n",
      "needed for her physical wants, but she tossed on the bed nights and slept\r\n",
      "brokenly. She ate poorly and grew very thin, very pale. She walked, days,\r\n",
      "until her body cried out for mercy. She cancelled her engagement, for she\r\n",
      "was unfitted for service, and intuitively she knew that, for her, a great\r\n",
      "change was near.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she was weak from weariness and lonely to the verge of exhaustion,\r\n",
      "she thought of Kenmore--not Travers--with positive yearning. The woman\r\n",
      "of her, madly defending, or about to defend, woman, excluded even her own\r\n",
      "love and her own man. It was sex against sex; the world's injustice\r\n",
      "against all that woman held sacred! If Margaret were to be sacrificed, so\r\n",
      "was she, for she blindly felt that Travers would not uphold her! How\r\n",
      "could he when tradition held him captive? How could he when his oath\r\n",
      "bound him like a slave? Doctor Hapgood had done his part, had spoken his\r\n",
      "word--to man! But that was not enough. Man had flaunted it, was willing\r\n",
      "to take--the chance without giving the woman intelligent choice. Oh! it\r\n",
      "was cruel, it was unjust, and it must be defied. She and Margaret must\r\n",
      "stand side by side, or life never again would taste sweet and pure!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla had not heard from Travers in ten days, and this added to her\r\n",
      "sense of desolation. Then, one evening, coming in from a long tramp in\r\n",
      "the park, snow covered and bedraggled, she faced him in her own little\r\n",
      "parlour!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "chair and lighted the tiny gas log in the grate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ferociously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Since I--I was in Switzerland.\" The sob aroused Travers to the girl's\r\n",
      "condition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You poor little tyke!\" he said. \"Now lean back and do as you're told.\r\n",

      "bear myself. I came to you from the vessel. I sent mother home in a cab.\r\n",

      "and Joan. You poor little girl! Heavens! how big your eyes are, and how\r\n",
      "frightened! Come in! Yes. This is the order; serve it here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The waiter took the order wrapped in a good-sized bill, and departed on\r\n",
      "willing feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your hair is about all that's familiar; longing for me couldn't take the\r\n",
      "shine from that!\" Travers kissed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see my next case,\" he laughed. \"To get you in shape will be quite an\r\n",
      "achievement. We both need--play. We thrive on that.\"\r\n",

      "\"Yes, my dear, my dear; but I have forgotten how!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "How Travers managed it no one could tell, but his own unfettered joy\r\n",
      "drove doubt and care from the little room. Priscilla, warmed and\r\n",
      "comforted, laughed and responded, and the meal was a merry one. But it\r\n",
      "was over at last, and the grim spectre stalked once more. Travers noticed\r\n",

      "boundless faith in his love and power to drive the cloud away. After the\r\n",
      "room was cleared of dishes and the grateful waiter, Travers attacked the\r\n",
      "shadow at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "great injustice clearly as I do; but you--all men have tried to right it\r\n",
      "by themselves, in their way, while all women, through all the ages, have\r\n",
      "stood aside and tried to think they were doing God's will when they\r\n",
      "accepted--your best; your _half_ best! Now, oh! now something--I think it\r\n",
      "is God calling loud to them--is waking them up. They know--you cannot do\r\n",

      "unwillingness--I am sure, even though her heart broke, she would do\r\n",
      "this--to marry Huntter. Then the matter would lie among men; men with the\r\n",
      "traditional viewpoint; men with much, much at stake. If Huntter has, as\r\n",
      "you say, taken the chance, in his love for Margaret--and he does love\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "by a sharp stab of memory, Ledyard's words, back in the boyhood days at\r\n",
      "Kenmore, stung Travers. They were like an echo in his brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--you of all women, cannot say that and mean it, my darling!\" he\r\n",
      "cried, and tried to draw her to him. She resisted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Our love, the one sacred thing of our very own,\" he pleaded, \"is in\r\n",
      "peril.\" He saw it now. \"Can you not see? Even if it is woman against\r\n",
      "woman, what right have you, Priscilla, to cloud and hurt our love?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is not--woman against woman--any more.\" The words came sweetly,\r\n",
      "almost joyously; something like renunciation tinged them. \"It is woman\r\n",
      "_for_ woman until men will take us by the hands, trustingly, faithfully,\r\n",
      "and work with us for what belongs equally to us both!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The radiance of the uplifted eyes frightened Travers. So might she look,\r\n",
      "he thought, had she passed through death and come out victorious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, just for a time,\" the tense, thrilling voice went on, \"she and\r\n",
      "I--women--must stand alone, and do our best as we see it. It is no good\r\n",
      "leaving it to--to any man. I see that! And our love, yours and mine! Oh!\r\n",
      "dear man of my heart, that can never die or be hurt. It is yours, mine!\r\n",
      "God gave it. God will not take it away. God will not take Margaret's\r\n",
      "either. She will understand, and, even alone, far, far from _her_ love,\r\n",
      "she will be true, as I will be. That is what it means to us!\" Then she\r\n",
      "paused and smiled at Travers as across a widening chasm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--am going now!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No. I am--going, because, as things are, I cannot--trust you, even you!\r\n",
      "That is our penalty for the world's wrong. Long, long ago some one--oh!\r\n",
      "it was back in the days when I did not know what life meant--some one\r\n",
      "told me--never to let any one kill my ideal! No one ever has! It goes on\r\n",
      "before, leading and beckoning. I must follow. I do not know where he is,\r\n",
      "he who told me, but I know, as sure as I know that I shall always love\r\n",
      "you, that he is following _his_ ideal, and living true and sure. Good\r\n",
      "night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unable to think or act, Travers saw Priscilla take up her still damp coat\r\n",
      "and hat. Like a man in a nightmare he saw her turn a deadly white face\r\n",
      "upon him, and then the door closed and he was alone in her little room!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked about, dazed and emotionless. He felt _her_ in every touch\r\n",
      "of the lonely place; her books, her little pictures, herself! Some women\r\n",
      "are like that: they leave themselves in the presence of them they\r\n",
      "love--forever!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Kill her ideal!\" The words rang in the empty corners of his heart and\r\n",
      "mind. \"Somewhere he is following his ideal, and living true and sure!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unconsciously, as men do in an hour of stress, Travers turned to action.\r\n",
      "Presently he found himself setting the tiny room in order as one does\r\n",
      "after a dear one has departed, or a spirit taken its flight. And while he\r\n",
      "moved about his reason was slowly readjusting itself, and he felt\r\n",
      "poignantly his impotency, his inability to use even his love for\r\n",
      "dominance. Being a just and honest man, he could not deny what Priscilla\r\n",
      "had said; truth rang in every sentence, chimed in with the minor notes of\r\n",
      "his life. No thought of following or staying her entered his mind; she\r\n",
      "had set about her business, woman's business, and, to the man's excited\r\n",
      "fancy, he seemed to see her pressing forward to the doing of that to\r\n",
      "which her soul called her. Then it was her beautiful shining hair he\r\n",
      "remembered, and his passion cried out for its own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This comes,\" he fiercely cried, setting his teeth hard, \"of our leaving\r\n",
      "them behind--our women! Through the ages their place has been beside us\r\n",
      "as we fought every foe of the race. We set them aside in our folly, and\r\n",
      "now\"--he bowed his head upon his folded arms--\"and now they are waking up\r\n",
      "and demanding only what is theirs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A specimen of the new man was Travers, but inheritance, and Ledyard's\r\n",
      "teaching, had left their seal upon him. Bowed in Priscilla's little room\r\n",
      "he tried to see his way, but for a time he reasoned with Ledyard's words\r\n",
      "ringing in his ears. Had he not gone over this with his friend and\r\n",
      "partner many a time?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know the cursed evil, know its power and danger! Yes, it\r\n",
      "threatens--the race, but it has its roots in the ages; it must be\r\n",
      "tackled cautiously. If we take the stand you suggest\"--for Travers had\r\n",
      "put forth his violent, new opposition--\"what will happen? The quacks and\r\n",
      "money-making sharks will get the upper hand. Do you think men would come\r\n",
      "to us if exposure faced them? It's the devil, my boy; but of the two\r\n",
      "evils this, God knows, is the least. We must do what we can; work for\r\n",
      "a scientific and moral redemption, but never play the game like\r\n",
      "fools.\"--\"But the women,\" Travers had put in feverishly, \"the\r\n",
      "women!\"--\"Spare me, boy! The women have clutched the heart of me--always.\r\n",
      "The women and the--the babies. I've used them to flay many men into\r\n",
      "remorse and better living. I am thinking of them, as God hears me, when I\r\n",
      "take the course I do!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so Travers suffered and groaned in the small, deserted room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Above and beyond Ledyard's reasoning stood two desolate figures. They\r\n",
      "seemed to represent all women: his Priscilla and Margaret Moffatt! One,\r\n",
      "the crude child of nature with her gleam undimmed, leading her forth\r\n",
      "unhampered, though love and suffering blocked her way; the other, the\r\n",
      "daughter of ages of refinement and culture, who had heard the call of the\r\n",
      "future in her big woman-heart and could leave all else for the sake of\r\n",
      "the crown she might never wear, but which, with God's help, she would\r\n",
      "never defile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On, on, they two went before Travers's aching eyes. The way before them\r\n",
      "was shining, or was it the light of Priscilla's hair? They were leaving\r\n",
      "him, all men, in the dark! It was to seek the light, or----And then\r\n",
      "Travers got up and left the room with bowed head, like one turning his\r\n",
      "back upon the dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went to Ledyard at once, and found that cheerful gentleman awaiting\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At last!\" he cried. \"Helen telephoned at seven. She thought you were on\r\n",
      "your way here. Did you get lost?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter, Dick? You look as if you had seen a ghost.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have. An army of them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you--ill?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sit down, boy. Here, take a swallow of wine. You're used up. Now then!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Doctor Ledyard, you were wrong--about Huntter! You remember what you\r\n",
      "told me, before Margaret Moffatt announced her engagement?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes.\" Ledyard poured himself a glass of wine and walked to his chair\r\n",

      "\"Before!\"\r\n",

      "All those others--men! men! men! Only she and Margaret, suffering and\r\n",
      "alone, would stand in the ruins. But from those ruins! Her eyes shone as\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I wish I could tell you--all about it!\" the weak, human need called to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "did you hide from me? Where were you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In--Bermuda.\" How ghastly it sounded, but it caught Margaret's quick\r\n",

      "spirits of the summer! When are you to be married? I must tell him to\r\n",
      "bully you as--as my dear love is bullying me! Has Doctor Ledyard growled\r\n",
      "at you? I can twist him easily! He is a darling, and just wears that face\r\n",
      "and voice for fun in order to scare little redheaded nurses. Cilla, dear\r\n",
      "heart, I'm going to be married in June! Dear, old-fashioned June, with\r\n",

      "\"Mr. Clyde Huntter?\" And then Margaret Moffatt came close to Priscilla,\r\n",
      "and looked down deep into the unfaltering eyes raised to hers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mr. Clyde Huntter--is the man I am to marry!\" she said in a voice from\r\n",
      "which the girlish banter had gone forever. It was the voice of a woman in\r\n",
      "arms to defend all she worshipped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I know. I was in his room the day you called. I thought I should\r\n",

      "did not tell!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "trust you, tell me what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then Priscilla had told her. At first Margaret stood, taking the\r\n",
      "deadly blow like a Spartan woman, her grave eyes fixed upon Priscilla.\r\n",
      "Slowly the cruel truth, and all it implied, found its way through the\r\n",
      "armour of her nobility and faith. She began to droop; then, like one\r\n",
      "whose strength has departed, she dropped beside Priscilla's chair and\r\n",
      "clung to her. It had not taken long to tell, but it had lain low every\r\n",
      "beautiful thing but--courage!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Back there,\" Margaret had said at last, \"back there where we played, I\r\n",
      "told you I was ready for sacrifice. I thought my God was not going to\r\n",
      "exact that, but since he has, I am ready. Priscilla, I still have God! I\r\n",
      "wonder\"--and, oh! how the weak, pain-filled voice had wrung Priscilla's\r\n",
      "heart--\"I wonder if you can understand when I tell you that I love my\r\n",
      "love better now--than ever? Shall always love him, my poor boy! Can you\r\n",
      "not see that he did not mean--to be evil? It was the curse handed down to\r\n",
      "him, and when he found out--his love, our love, had taken possession of\r\n",
      "him, and he could not let me--go! I feel as if--as if I were his mother!\r\n",
      "He cannot have the thing he would die for, but I shall love him to the\r\n",
      "end of life. I shall try to make it up to him--in some way; help him to\r\n",
      "be willing and brave, to do the right; teach him that my way is the\r\n",
      "only--honourable way. I am sure both he and I will be--glad not--not to\r\n",
      "let others, oh! such sad, little others, pay the debt for us. Our day\r\n",
      "is--is short at best, but the--the eternity! And you, dear, faithful\r\n",
      "Cilla! You, with your blessed love, how will it be when I have done what\r\n",
      "I must do? I must go to--to father and tell the truth, and then----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know,\" Priscilla had said. \"Doctor Travers told me what would follow.\r\n",
      "I shall not be here for him to suffer for; I am going----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where, my precious friend?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To--the Place Beyond the Winds! You do not understand. You cannot; no\r\n",
      "one can follow me; but I cannot bear the hurting blasts any more. I want\r\n",
      "the In-Place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then it was over, and now she was back in her lonely rooms. She packed\r\n",
      "her few, dear possessions, and toward morning lay down upon her bed. At\r\n",
      "daylight she departed, after settling her affairs with the night clerk\r\n",
      "and leaving no directions that any one could follow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is business,\" she had cautioned, and the sleepy fellow nodded his\r\n",
      "head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest did not matter. She would travel to the port from which the\r\n",
      "boats sailed to Kenmore. Any boat would do; any time. Some morning,\r\n",
      "perhaps, at four o'clock, if the passage had not been too rough, she\r\n",
      "would find herself on the shabby little wharf with the pink morning light\r\n",
      "about her, and the red-rock road stretching on before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Priscilla, like a miser, gripped her purse. Never before had money\r\n",
      "held any power over her, but the hundreds she had saved were precious to\r\n",
      "her now. Her father's doors were still, undoubtedly, closed to her. She\r\n",
      "could not be a burden to the two men living in Master Farwell's small\r\n",
      "home. There was, to be sure, Mary McAdam! By and by, perhaps, when the\r\n",
      "hurt was less and she could trust herself more, she would go to the White\r\n",
      "Fish Lodge and beg for employment; but until then----\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The morning Priscilla departed, Ledyard, unequal to any further strain,\r\n",
      "was called upon to bear several. By his plate, at the breakfast table,\r\n",
      "lay a scrawled envelope that he recognized at once as a report from\r\n",
      "Tough Pine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's up now?\" muttered he. \"This thing isn't due for--three weeks\r\n",
      "yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he read, laboriously, the crooked lines:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  I give up job. Dirty work. Money--bad money. I take no more--or I be\r\n",
      "  damned! He better man--than you was; you bad and evil, for fun--he grow\r\n",
      "  big and white. No work for bad man--friend now to good mens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  Pine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The devil!\" muttered Ledyard; but oddly enough the letter raised, rather\r\n",
      "than lowered, his mental temperature. Those ill-looking epistles of\r\n",
      "Pine's had nauseated him lately. He had begun to experience the sensation\r\n",
      "of over-indulgence. Some one had told him, a time back, of Boswell's\r\n",
      "leaving the city, and he had been glad of the suspicion that arose in him\r\n",
      "when he heard it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later in the day the forces Priscilla had set in motion touched and drew\r\n",
      "him into the maelstrom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ledyard\"--this over the telephone--\"my daughter has just informed me\r\n",
      "that she is about to break her engagement. May I see you at--three?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes. Here, or at your office?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will come to you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had it out, man to man, and with all the time-honoured and hoary\r\n",
      "arguments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My girl's a fool!\" Moffatt panted, red-faced and eloquent. \"Not to\r\n",
      "mention what this really means to all of us, there is the girl's own\r\n",
      "happiness at stake. What are we to tell the world? You cannot go about\r\n",
      "and--explain! Good Lord! Ledyard, Huntter stands so high in public esteem\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No. The thing's got to die,\" Ledyard mused. \"Die at its birth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Die in my girl's heart! Good God! Ledyard, you ought to see her after\r\n",
      "the one night! It wrings my heart. It isn't as if the slander had killed\r\n",
      "her love for him. It hasn't; it has strengthened it. 'I must bear this\r\n",
      "for him and for me,' she said, looking at me with her mother's eyes. She\r\n",
      "never looked like her mother before. It's broken me up. What's the world\r\n",
      "coming to, when women get the bit in their teeth?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There are times when all women look alike,\" Ledyard spoke half to\r\n",
      "himself; \"I've noticed that.\" The rest of Moffatt's sentence he ignored.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, in the name of all that is good,\" Moffatt blazed away, \"did you\r\n",
      "send that redheaded girl into our lives? I might have known from the hour\r\n",
      "she set her will against mine that she was no good omen. Things I haven't\r\n",
      "crushed, Ledyard, have always ended by giving me a blow, sooner or later.\r\n",

      "ended in a gulp. \"Let me send Margaret to you,\" pleaded the father at his\r\n",
      "wits' end. \"Huntter is away. Will not be back until to-morrow. Perhaps\r\n",
      "you can move her. You brought her into the world; you ought to try and\r\n",
      "keep her here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At four Margaret entered Ledyard's office. She was very white, very\r\n",
      "self-possessed, but gently smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear old friend,\" she said, drawing near him and taking the role of\r\n",
      "comforter at once. \"Do not think I blame you. I know you did your best\r\n",
      "with your blessed, nigh-to glasses on, but we younger folks have long\r\n",
      "vision, you know. Do you remember how you once told me to swallow your\r\n",
      "pills without biting them? I obeyed you for a long, long time; but I've\r\n",
      "bitten this one! It's bitter, but it is for the best. The medicine is in\r\n",
      "the pills; we might as well know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"See here, Margaret, I'm not going to use your father's weapons. I only\r\n",
      "ask you--to wait! Do not break your engagement; let me see Huntter. Do\r\n",
      "not speak to him of this. I can explain, and--\" he paused--\"if the worse\r\n",

      "gradually.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" Margaret shook her head. \"This is his affair and mine, and our love\r\n",

      "to writing. He's always told me that when he could afford to, he'd like\r\n",
      "to cut the traces and wollop the race with his pen. Many doctors would\r\n",
      "like to do that. A gag and a chain and ball are not what they're cracked\r\n",

      "enough to want to live on my husband's money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "mother, had gone away?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There had been workmen in the house, evidently. They had carelessly left\r\n",
      "the outer door open and a box of tools in the living-room. Travers went\r\n",
      "in and sat down upon the chest, closed his eyes, and gave himself up to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Little son, is that you?\" Yes, it was surely he! \"Come home to--to\r\n",
      "mother? Tired, dear?\" Indeed he was tired--tired to the verge of\r\n",
      "exhaustion. \"Suppose--suppose we have a story? Come, little son! It shall\r\n",
      "be a story of a fine, golden-haired princess who loves and loves, but--is\r\n",
      "very, very wise. And you are to be the prince who is wise, too. If you\r\n",
      "are not both very wise there will be trouble; and of course princesses\r\n",

      "The pines and the hemlocks stood out sharply against a pink, throbbing\r\n",
      "sky in which the stars still shone faintly but brilliantly. It was five\r\n",
      "o'clock of a dim morning, and no one was astir in the In-Place as the\r\n",
      "little steamer indolently turned from the Big Bay into the Channel and\r\n",
      "headed for the wharf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a breath of air seemed stirring, and the stillness was unbroken\r\n",
      "except by the panting of the engines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla Glenn stood near the gangway of the boat. Now that she had left\r\n",
      "all her beautiful love and life, she was eager to hide, like a hurt and\r\n",
      "bruised thing, in the old, familiar home. Leaning her poor, tired head\r\n",
      "against the post near her, she thought of the desolate wreck behind, and\r\n",
      "the tears came to the deep, true eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I could have done--nothing else!\" she murmured, as if to comfort the sad\r\n",
      "thing she was. \"It had to be! Margaret knew that; she understood. By now\r\n",
      "she is as bereft as I; poor, dear love! Oh! it seems, just sometimes it\r\n",
      "seems, like an army of men on one side and all of us women on the other.\r\n",
      "Between us lies the great battlefield, and they, the men, are trying to\r\n",
      "fight alone--fight our battle as well as theirs. And--they cannot! they\r\n",
      "cannot!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just then the boat touched the wharf, and a sleepy man, a stranger to\r\n",
      "Priscilla, materialized and looked at her queerly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For the Lodge?\" he grunted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes--I suppose so. Yes, the Lodge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Up yonder.\" Then he turned to the freight. Once she was on the Green,\r\n",
      "Priscilla paused and looked about.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For which?\" Then she smiled a ghost of her bright, sunny smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My father's doors are shut to me,\" she sighed; \"I cannot go to the\r\n",
      "Lodge, yet! I must go--to----\" Something touched her hand, and she\r\n",
      "looked down. It was Farwell's dog, the old one, the one who used to play\r\n",
      "with Priscilla when she was a little girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You dear!\" she cried, dropping beside him; \"You've come to show me the\r\n",
      "way. Beg, Tony, beg like a good fellow. I have a bit of cake for you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clumsily, heavily, the old collie tried to respond, but of late he had\r\n",
      "been excused from acting; and he was old, old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then take it, Tony, take it without pay. That comes of being a doggie.\r\n",
      "You ought to be grateful that you are a dog, and--need not pay!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was clear to her now that Farwell's home must be her first shelter,\r\n",
      "and taking up her suit-case she passed over the Green and took the path\r\n",
      "leading to the master's house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some one had been before her. Some one who had swept the hearth, lighted\r\n",
      "a fire, and set the breakfast table. Pine had taken Toky's place and was\r\n",
      "vying with that deposed oriental in whole-souled service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla pushed the ever-unlatched door open and went inside. The bare\r\n",
      "living-room had been transformed. John Boswell had transferred the\r\n",
      "comfort, without the needless luxury, from the town home to the\r\n",
      "In-Place--books, pictures, rugs, the winged chair and an equally easy one\r\n",
      "across the hearth. And, yes, there was her own small rocker close by, as\r\n",
      "if, in their detachment, they still remembered her and missed her and\r\n",
      "were--ready for her coming! Priscilla noiselessly took off her wraps and\r\n",
      "sat down, glad to rest again in the welcoming chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She swayed back and forth, her closely folded arms across her\r\n",
      "fast-beating heart. She kept her face turned toward the door through\r\n",
      "which she knew the men would enter. She struggled for control, for a\r\n",
      "manner which would disarm their shock at seeing her; but never in her\r\n",
      "life had she felt more defeated, more helplessly at bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The early morning light, streaming through the broad eastern window,\r\n",
      "struck full across her where she sat in the low rocker; and so Boswell\r\n",
      "and Farwell came upon her. They stopped short on the threshold and each,\r\n",
      "in his way, sought to account for the apparition. The brave smile upon\r\n",
      "Priscilla's face broke and fled miserably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I--I've been doshed!\" she cried in a last effort at bravado, and then,\r\n",
      "covering her face with her hands, she wept hysterically, repeating again\r\n",
      "and again, \"I've come home, come home--to--no home!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were beside her at once. Boswell's hand rested on the bowed head;\r\n",
      "Farwell's on the back of her chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear, bright Butterfly!\" whispered Boswell comfortingly; \"it has come to\r\n",
      "grief in the Garden.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! I wanted to learn, and oh! Master Farwell, I said I was willing to\r\n",
      "suffer, and I have, I have!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then she looked up and her unflinching courage returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was tired!\" she moaned; \"tired and hungry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"After breakfast you will explain--only as much as you choose, child.\"\r\n",
      "This from Farwell. \"Make the toast for us, Priscilla. I remember how\r\n",
      "you used to brown it without blackening it. Boswell always gets dreaming\r\n",
      "on the second side of the slice.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the strange meal Priscilla told very little, but both men read\r\n",
      "volumes in her pale, thin face and understanding eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn them!\" thought Farwell; \"they have taken it out of her. I knew they\r\n",
      "would; but they have not conquered her!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Boswell thoughtfully considered her when her eyes were turned from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She learned,\" he thought; \"suffered and learned; but when she gets her\r\n",
      "breath she will go back. The In-Place cannot hold her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they told her of the Kenmore folk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your father has had a stroke, Priscilla,\" Farwell said in reply to her\r\n",
      "question; \"it has made him blind. Long Jean cares for him. He will have\r\n",
      "no other near him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And--he never wants me?\" Priscilla whispered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; but he needs you!\" Boswell muttered. \"You must let your velvety\r\n",
      "wings brush his dark life; the touch will comfort him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And old Jerry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Farwell leaned forward to poke the fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Old Jerry,\" said he, \"has gone mildly--mad. All day he sits dressed in\r\n",
      "his best, ready to start for Jerry-Jo's. He fancies that scapegoat of his\r\n",
      "has a mansion and fortune, and is expecting his arrival. He amuses\r\n",
      "himself by packing and unpacking a mangy old carpet-bag. Mary McAdam\r\n",
      "looks after him and the village youngsters play with him. It's rather\r\n",
      "a happy ending, after all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Many a time after that Priscilla packed and unpacked the old carpet-bag,\r\n",
      "while Jerry rambled on of his great and splendid lad to the \"Miss from\r\n",
      "the States.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's weak I am to-day, ma'am,\" he would say, \"but to-morrow, to-morrow!\r\n",
      "'Tis the Secret Portage I'll make for; the Fox is a bit too tricky for my\r\n",
      "boat--a fine boat, ma'am. I'm thinking the Big Bay may be a trifle rough,\r\n",
      "but the boat's a staunch one. Jerry-Jo's expecting me; but he'll\r\n",
      "understand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am sure he will be glad to see you, sir.\" Priscilla learned to play\r\n",
      "the sad game. The children taught her and loved her, and all the quiet\r\n",
      "village kept her secret. Mary McAdam claimed her, but Priscilla clung\r\n",
      "to the two men who meant the only comfort she could know. They never\r\n",
      "questioned her; never intruded upon her sad, and often pitiful, reserve;\r\n",
      "but they yearned over her and cheered her as best they could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla's visits to her father's house were often dramatic. At first\r\n",
      "the sound of her voice disturbed and excited the blind man pathetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh? eh?\" he stormed, holding to Long Jean's hand; \"who comes in my\r\n",
      "door?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! a lass--from the States,\" Jean replied with a reassuring pat on the\r\n",
      "bony shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From the States?\" suspiciously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye. She's taken training in one of them big hospitables, and is a\r\n",

      "altars, and sometimes even my God seems----\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An Unknown God?\" Priscilla asked tenderly. \"That must be such a lonely\r\n",
      "feeling.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No!\" almost shrieked Nathaniel, as if the suggestion insulted him; \"no!\r\n",

      "of it, young Miss?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Priscilla turned her eyes to the open, free outer world, where the\r\n",
      "sunshine was and the stirring of spring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she whispered, \"I love to think of God coming down from all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou blasphemer!\" Glenn struggled to an upright position and his\r\n",

      "the second time Priscilla was ordered from her father's house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It did not matter. It was all so useless, and the future was so blank.\r\n",
      "Still, to go back to Master Farwell's just then was impossible, and\r\n",
      "Priscilla turned toward the wood road leading to the Far Hill Place. She\r\n",
      "had no plan, no purpose. She was drifting, drifting, and could not see\r\n",
      "her way. The bright sun touched her comfortingly. In the shadow it was\r\n",
      "chilly; but the red rock was warm and luring. And so she came to the open\r\n",
      "space and the almost forgotten shrine where once she had raised her\r\n",
      "Strange God.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sat down upon a fallen tree and looked over the little, many-islanded\r\n",
      "bay to the Secret Portage. Through that she seemed to pass yearningly,\r\n",
      "and her eyes grew large and strained. Then she stretched out her arms,\r\n",
      "her young, empty arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My Garden!\" she called; \"my Garden, my dear, dear love and Margaret's\r\n",
      "God! Margaret's and mine!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so she sat for a while longer. Then, because the chill air crept\r\n",
      "closer and closer, she arose and faced the old, bleached skull. The\r\n",
      "winters had killed the sheltering vines that once hid it from all eyes\r\n",
      "but hers. It stood bare and hideous, as if demanding that she again\r\n",
      "worship it. A frenzy overpowered Priscilla. That whitened, dead thing\r\n",
      "brought back memories that hurt and stung by their very sweetness. She\r\n",
      "rushed to the spot and seized the forked stick upon which the skull\r\n",
      "rested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This for all--Unknown Gods!\" she cried in breathless passion, and dashed\r\n",
      "the skull to the ground. \"And this! and this!\" She trampled it. \"They\r\n",
      "shall not keep you upon shrines! They shall not keep you hidden from all\r\n",
      "in the Garden!\" With that she took a handful of the shattered god and\r\n",
      "flung it far and wide, with her blazing eyes fixed on the Secret Portage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Standing so, she looked like a priestess of old defying all falseness and\r\n",
      "traditional wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among the trees Richard Travers gazed upon the scene with a kind of\r\n",
      "horror gripping him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not a superstitious man, but he was a worn and weary one, and he\r\n",
      "had come to the Far Hill Place, two days before, because, after much\r\n",
      "searching, he had failed to find Priscilla Glynn, and his love was hurt\r\n",
      "and desperate. He had wanted to hide and suffer where no eyes could\r\n",
      "penetrate. But he had discovered that for a man to return to his boyhood\r\n",
      "was but to undergo the torture of those who are haunted by lost spirits.\r\n",
      "It had been damnable--that dreary, dismantled house back on the hill!\r\n",
      "The nights had maddened him and left him unable to cope intelligently\r\n",
      "with the days. Nothing comforting had been there. The pale boy he once\r\n",
      "had been taunted him with memories of lowered ideals, unfilled promise\r\n",
      "and purpose. He had travelled a long distance from the Far Hill Place,\r\n",
      "and he was going back to fight it out--somehow, somewhere. He would\r\n",
      "stop at Master Farwell's and then take the night steamer for the old\r\n",
      "battle-ground. And just at that moment, in the open space, he saw the\r\n",
      "strange sight that stopped his breath and heart for an instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course his wornout senses were being tricked. He had known of such\r\n",
      "cases, and was now thoroughly alarmed. Like a man in delirium, he walked\r\n",
      "into the open and confronted the fascinated gaze of the girl for whom he\r\n",
      "had been searching for weeks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How came--you here?\" he asked in a voice from which normal emotions were\r\n",
      "eliminated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And--you?\" she echoed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Why--I am--I meant to tell you--some day. I am Priscilla Glenn--not\r\n",
      "Glynn--Priscilla Glenn of--Lonely Farm.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My God!\" Travers came a step nearer, his face set and grim. \"Of course!\r\n",

      "village?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the--the tune that made me cry. Who--are----How did _you_ know that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Their hands touched and clung now, desperately. Together they must find\r\n",
      "their way out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am--I was--the boy of the Far Hill Place. I played for you--once--to\r\n",
      "dance--right here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something seemed snapping in Priscilla's brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she whispered, breathing hard and quick. \"I remember now: you\r\n",
      "taught me music, and--and you taught me--love, but you told me not to let\r\n",
      "them kill my ideal; and, oh! I haven't! I haven't!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shut her eyes and reeled forward. She did not faint, but for a moment\r\n",
      "her senses refused to accept impressions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Travers knelt and caught her to him as she fell. Her dear head was upon\r\n",
      "his knee once more, and he pressed his lips to the wonderful hair from\r\n",
      "which the little hat had fallen. Then her eyes opened, but her lips\r\n",
      "trembled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You--came all the way from the Place Beyond the Winds, little girl, to\r\n",
