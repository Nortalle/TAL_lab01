    "## Objectives\n",
    "The goal of the second part of the first [TAL](http://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/cours-tal/) lab is to run simple operations for text analysis using the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) toolkit.  You will use the environment that you set up in the first part of the first lab (Labo 1a): [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, either using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use NLTK functions to get texts from the web or local files, and segment (split) them into sentences and words (also called *tokens*).  You will also experiment with extracting some statistics about the texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your practical work to the teachers, please execute all cells of your Jupyter notebook, then print it as a PDF document, and [email both files to the teacher](mailto:andrei.popescu-belis@heig-vd.ch)."

    "You should now add NLTK to your local Python installation, by following the instructions at the [NLTK website](http://www.nltk.org/install.html).  On Google Colab, NLTK is already installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started with NLTK is to look at [Chapter 1](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html) of the [NLTK book (NLP with Python)](http://www.nltk.org/book/) and to try some of the instructions there.  Note that the online book is updated for Python 3, but the printed book, also available in PDF on some websites, is only for Python 2 ([_Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit_, Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper, O'Reilly Media, 2009](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516499.do)). \n",
    "\n",
    "To use NLTK in a Jupyter notebook, all you need is to `import nltk` before you need it.  You will still need to use the prefix `nltk.` unless you write for instance: `from nltk.book import *` (this will also import and define several long texts too).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* NLTK includes a download manager which can be called from a Python interpreter using `import nltk` and then `nltk.download()`.  This can automatically download from the NLTK repository a large number of text collections (_corpora_).  In this practical session, we will not use any of these."
